# Detailed Policy

### The Problem: 

Human Dignity has fallen off to the way side of provincial concerns, dropping so far as to attack the inherent dignity and rights of the most vulnerable children in our province. We cannot move forward if we are stuck in old ways of thinking.

### The Promise:

An NCP Government will not just simply promise uphold Human Dignity, rather it will bind itself by law so that the primary duty of any Government of Saskatchewan is first and foremost to respect, protect, and uphold Human Dignity. 

### The Plan:

 The NCP will put forward The Saskatchewan Human Dignity Act. This Act will make three binding proclamations that will be the fiduciary duty of all governmental action going forward. 
 
1. Human Dignity is inherent and inviolable. 
2. The primary duty of all provincial authority is to respect, protect, and uphold Human Dignity.
3. Indignity can never excuse further indignity. 

The Act will state that all other enactments and decisions shall, to the extent possible, be ready consistently with this Act. Any later Acts intending to limit or change these declarations must clearly and expressly say so. 

The Act will empower The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission with the funding and authority to investigate claims of breached dignity by, and issue binding recommendations to, the Government of Saskatchewan. 

The Act will state that anyone who claims serious, demonstrable, harm to their dignity, by act or omission of the province, may appeal to this newly empowered Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission. 

If satisfaction still cannot be reached a person may apply for the Court of Kings Bench for relief, after all ordinary appeals and attempts at satisfaction are exhausted. 

Corporations and other private entities are will be explicitly exempted from the dignity protections. 

The Human Rights Code shall be amended to ensure its interpretation is made specifically to uphold and protect the inherent dignity of all as well as include and strengthen protections based on:

1. Neurodiversity
2. Gender Identity and Expression 
3. Any physical or mental disability 
4. Social Condition
	- Source of Income
	- Employment Status
	- Housing Status

### The Funding:

Capacity funding will be granted from the General Revenue Fund so that experts in Ethics and Human Rights Law can write the Saskatchewan Human Dignity Act to expertly bind the Government of Saskatchewan into respecting, upholding, and protecting Human Dignity for all.

### What it Means for You:

It means by law your government must respect you. 

It means no matter what, your dignity is your right. 

It means meeting the expectations of the 21st Century.

# FAQ

- What does "Human Dignity" mean in practice?
	- It means the government is legally required to treat you with respect in everything it does. If a government policy or decision seriously harms your dignity, you have the right to challenge it.

- Does this apply to private businesses?
	- No. Corporations and private entities are explicitly exempted from the dignity protections in this Act. The Act binds the Government of Saskatchewan and its actions only.

- How do I make a complaint if my dignity is violated by the government?
	- You would first appeal to the newly empowered Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission, which will investigate and issue binding recommendations. If you still can't find satisfaction, you may then apply to the Court of King's Bench for relief.

- Why amend the Human Rights Code?
	- To strengthen and expand protections for groups that are currently underprotected, including neurodiversity, gender identity and expression, disabilities, and social conditions like housing status and source of income.

- Does this Act override other laws?
	- All other laws must be read consistently with this Act to the extent possible. If a future government wants to limit these protections, it must say so clearly and expressly in the new law.
