# Detailed Policy:

### The Problem 

Housing has become a speculative commodity, influencing both supply and demand, price and availability, in ways that do not benefit anyone outside of shareholders. 

### The Promise

An NCP government will end the housing crisis. 

### The Plan

#### Short Term

The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Rental Rights Act:

The Act will enforce a Residential Rent Freeze for 5 Years. The freeze will sunset after that time. This will give renters immediate relief and peace of mind knowing they have some stability and time to adjust to the recent rapid increases to rent over the past five years. 

All new builds will be exempt from this rent freeze, so long as their starting rents are not above the median rent for comparable units in the same municipality, as determined by the Office of Residential Tenancies using standardized data.

Upgrades for life and safety, building envelope, and accessibility will be eligible for Capital Repair Pass Throughs under clear rules to be set by the Office of Residential Tenancies. 

New builds and all residential rents following the freeze will be allowed to increase their rents on an annual basis with a cap of Saskatchewan's annual CPI inflation + 0.5%.

All residential landlords in the province must submit information about their property and proof of ownership to a new Saskatchewan Rental Registry, run by the Office of Residential Tenancies.

This registry will be public, with maps and lists of rental units showing key information so renters can easily see and make an informed choice on where to live. Landlords who do not register will not be eligible any grants or rebates. 

Starting the year the Act comes into force, on October 1 to April 30 of the following year, residential landlords are prohibited from evicting tenants, except in cases of serious health and safety concerns or severe, proven lease violations, such as property destructions, as determined by an independent tribunal. 

Rebates will be available from the Government of Saskatchewan for owners who complete safety, accessibility, or energy upgrades, including upgrades to meet new modern building standards. 

A vacancy tax, and a dormant land tax will be put in place on long-term empty and unused residential units or lots, as to ensure speculators and profiteers pay for keeping potential livable homes off the market. Primary residences and short, documented transition periods will be exempt under clear rules. 

The Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC) will be given major new investments and be directed to complete a Rapid Rebuild Program for their public housing stock by both renovating existing units and purchasing or long-term, or master leasing, existing housing units. 

The SHC will hire and use prequalified contractors to immediately begin inspecting and renovating every unit within SHC's housing supply, starting with the most neglected and distressed units. 

The SHC will also offer to pre-lease 30% of housing units in new developments and builds for a 30 year term if the starting rents are no higher than the median rent for comparable units in the same municipality, as determined by the Office of Residential Tenancies using standardized data. The operations and management of these units will be co-managed.

SGI will be instructed to offer optional renters and housing insurance as part of its main operations, making sure that such insurance is as cheap and ubiquitous as its auto insurance. 

The SGI insurance rates will vary to reward retrofitting and upgrades such as weatherization, heat pumps, solar power, battery storage, new modern code compliance, and other improvements will qualify homeowners for lower premiums. We will reward those who invest in the future. 

#### Long Term

Saskatchewan needs homes that will meet the needs of its people where they are, both today and in the future. An NCP government will immediately start creating a standardized housing design book for Saskatchewan made homes. 

These "SaskHomes" will have universal, modular, designs, using standardized supplies and materials, so that they can be built easily on site by hand, the traditional way we know how, and also off site in a new prefab modular housing factory. The Saskatchewan Housing Corporation will order 100,000 units for public housing over 10 - 15 years, ensuring that the factory has the demand to operate at full capacity, 24/7 and that the people have homes within their lifetimes. 

	See Policy 19 - Manufacturing for more. 

There will be a variety of unit types like single family homes that have an full unit downstairs, accessible senior's' mid-rises, walks ups, and townhouses. These units will be accessible by design so no matter your ability you can live with dignity and comfort. The rent will be strictly set at 30% of the tenant's family income. They will also be 100% compliant with new modern building codes, and be connected by default to the new geothermal ambient loops to heat and cool the home. 

	See Policy 06 - 21st Century Connected Communities for more.

Homeowners will have access to low or no-interest loans, depending on their yearly income, through SaskEnergy, SaskPower, and the SHC to retrofit existing homes to meet new building code standards. The updated building codes will be written in consultation with industry experts to ensure that all future builds and retrofits are ready for the 21 century. The new standards will include:

- Meeting "Passive House" level or equivalent efficiency. 
- Being "Net-Zero" and climate resilient.
- Being super insulated and weatherized inside and out. 
- Ensuring clean indoor air that is ready for the heaviest wildfire smoke and respiratory pandemics with air exchange and HEPA filtration at 6-8 Air Changes per hour (ACH).
- Being universally accessible with: 
	- Wide spaces for mobility devices.
	- Braille and tactile features where appropriate.
	- Both auditory and visual alarm systems.
- Being prewired and structurally ready for decentralized energy options like solar panels and battery storage. 
- Provide abundant natural light. 
- Building materials that are:
	- Non-toxic.
	- Fire resistant.
	- Documented via "Material Passports" (records of all materials used, their location, and expected lifespan) so we know what was used, where, and when it needs upgrading. 
- Include water systems that are efficient and allow for grey water recycling where feasible.  
- All wiring must be child-safe yet accessible, so it can be easily replaced and upgraded.
- Ensure a certain level of acoustic comfort for every unit. 

Additionally, the NCP will instruct the newly created Saskatchewan Co-operative Development Agency (SCDA) to come up with a target to transition at least 20% of new public housing stock to co-operative ownership within 10 years of construction, with priority given to buildings where a majority of tenants express interest in co-operative governance.

	See Policy 09 - Co-operative Development for more.

### The Funding

The immediate capital for the Rapid Rebuild Program and repair grants will come from the General Revenue Fund. 

For the long term housing build the upfront capital will be generated via bonds. The SaskBond Foundation Edition will be sold as Government Obligation (GO) Bonds. The capital from those bonds will be used to create the first batch of public housing units.

After the rental revenue from those established units is proven and stable we will securitize that housing and rental revenue into a SaskBond Housing Edition. The rental revenues will be split. 25% goes to the General Revenue Fund to help pay for maintenance and operations. 75% goes directly to the bond's coupon, which is also backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Saskatchewan. We will then repeat until we get 100,000 public housing units.

The junior tranche of the bonds will be purchased by the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund, which absorbs any revenue shortfalls before they affect senior bondholders. The senior tranche, sold to residents, pension funds, and institutional investors, is additionally backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Saskatchewan, ensuring bondholders are always paid in full.

	See Policy 17 - Financial Sovereignty for more. 
	See Policy 21 - Funding for more.

### What It Means For You

It means a future for your family. 

It means the dignity of your own space. 

It means no matter who you are, there is a home in Saskatchewan.
