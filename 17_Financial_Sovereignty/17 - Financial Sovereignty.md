# Detailed Policy 

#### The Problem

Saskatchewan does not capture, save, or utilize enough of its own wealth.

Saskatchewan's vibrant Credit Union Ecosystem is in need of modernization.

#### The Promise

The NCP will ensure Saskatchewan resource wealth is captured and secured for generations to come.

The NCP will create a wholesale development trust to ensure Saskatchewan's money is stored and used within Saskatchewan's borders. 

#### The Plan

The NCP will introduce the following two bills:

- The Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund Act
- The Saskatchewan Financial Group Act

With these Acts, Saskatchewan will be able to commit to a financially sovereign future. 

<strong><u>The Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund Act</u></strong>

A new Crown corporation to be known as the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund Agency (SSFA) will be mandated to create and manage a new, permanent, intergenerational endowment fund to be known as the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund (SSF).

The SSFA will be governed by a board of nine members: two appointed by the government, two by the Opposition, two by Indigenous Governing Bodies, and three independent members selected by the other six for expertise in investment management, Indigenous governance, and public finance. Board members serve staggered five-year terms and may be removed only for cause. This structure insulates the fund from short-term political pressure.

The SSFA board will maintain and publish an Ethical Investment Policy defining excluded industries and practices. The policy will be reviewed every three years with public consultation. Initial exclusions include: fossil fuel extraction and processing, tobacco production, weapons manufacturing, private prisons, and companies with documented severe labor or human rights violations.

The SSF will be seeded with an initial $500 million transfer from the General Revenue Fund in Year 1, with ongoing contributions from royalty revenues building the principal over time. 

Specifically, the SSF will receive its ongoing funded through resource royalty revenues and Crown Corporation dividends above a five year average. 15% of any and all resource royalty revenue collected from the new base rate will be sent to the SSF. 50% of the resource royalty revenues collected from the windfall rate will be sent to the SSF.

	See Policy 21 - Funding for more. 

The principal capital will be protected and secured for all future generations of Saskatchewan residents. It cannot be withdrawn or spent without a super-majority vote in favour in the Legislature.

The SSF will target a long-term real return of 4-5% annually through diversified investment. In early years, when the fund is smaller, interest disbursements will be supplemented from other revenue sources to maintain program funding. As the fund grows, interest alone will increasingly cover mandated expenditures.

The accrued annual interest of the SSF will be spent as use of proceeds funding to the General Revenue Fund. This annual interest payment will be split and by law can only be spent in the following ways: 

- 54% must be spent on the Saskatchewan Dignity Dividend (SDD).
- 15% must be spent on Reconciliation funding.
- 15% on Resilience and Energy Veterans funding.
- 10% on Debt Servicing.
- 5% on Strategic Domestic Investment like research. 
- 1% must be spent on administration of the fund and disbursement of payments. 

SSF disbursements will be indexed to Saskatchewan CPI. In years when nominal returns exceed inflation-adjusted targets, the excess will flow to program enhancement or the Stabilization Reserve.

Changes to the SSF spending formula require the same supermajority vote as accessing principal, ensuring long-term stability of program funding.

The SSF will make investments that are diversified across multiple sectors and jurisdictions to ensure stability and growth. To smooth annual disbursements, the SSF will maintain a Stabilization Reserve equal to two years of expected program funding. In years when returns fall below targets, the Reserve will cover the shortfall. In years when returns exceed targets, excess funds will replenish the Reserve before flowing to programs.

The SSF will maintain a diversified portfolio with target allocations of approximately 40% global equities, 30% fixed income, 20% real assets (infrastructure, real estate), and 10% alternative investments. Allocations will be reviewed annually by the SSFA board with independent actuarial advice.

There will be no investments in fossil fuels, tobacco, weapons, or other morally questionable industries. All investments must be reported transparently to the public each quarter.

The SSF will invest only in ESG-screened funds or direct holdings that exclude prohibited industries. Where index investments are used, they must be fossil-free variants. The SSFA will publish an annual report on excluded holdings and the performance impact of ethical screening.

A part of the investments made by the SSF will be purchasing the entire junior tranche of any SaskBonds backed by revenues. Any proceeds from the lawsuit against the oil majors and Ottawa will go directly into funding the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund. 

Lawsuit proceeds, if obtained, will be deposited into the SSF principal. Given the potentially large scale of such proceeds, the SSFA board will develop a special integration plan to absorb funds without market disruption, potentially phasing deposits over multiple years. The spending formula will apply to returns generated by these funds, not the principal.

The SSFA will publish quarterly investment reports, annual audited financial statements, and an annual report to the Legislature. The annual report will include: total fund value, returns by asset class, fees paid to investment managers, ethical screening decisions, and projected future disbursements.

<strong><u>The Saskatchewan Financial Group:</u></strong> 

The Saskatchewan Financial Group (SFG) will be a new Crown corporation, mandated to act as a central depository for the Government of Saskatchewan and its Crowns. All of the Government of Saskatchewan's daily payments, and deposits, and anything to do with the Province's money will be done with the SFG instead of the Big 5 Banks. 

The Government of Saskatchewan currently maintains approximately $3 billion in operating balances with commercial banks. Transferring this float to the SFG will provide substantial capital for credit union support while generating returns that stay in Saskatchewan rather than flowing to bank shareholder.

The transition will be slow, phased over 36 months before all provincial monies are exclusively managed out of the SFG. We are not committing a bank run. It will be done department by department, Crown by Crown.

The goal for the SFG is to be capitalized with $1 billion in Year 1, representing a portion of the provincial operating float. Additional capital will transfer over the 36-month transition period as provincial accounts migrate from commercial banks.

The Credit Union Deposit Guarantee Corporation will appoint at least 51% of the SFG Board, ensuring credit union expertise guides the organization. They are the experts in Saskatchewan Capital. The goal is to get our own money to circulate and fund the things we build and do in Saskatchewan. It's about the velocity, or circular flow, of money. 

The SFG is not a bank, as that is federal jurisdiction. There won't be the regular loans given to people or businesses. However, the SFG will offer credit unions access to wholesale funding at rates tied to provincial borrowing costs plus a modest spread to cover administration. Credit unions accessing SFG funding must demonstrate that savings are passed to members through lower loan rates or higher deposit rates. The SFG may also purchase pools of credit union loans to provide liquidity and balance sheet relief.

Credit unions accessing SFG funding must submit annual rate comparisons showing their consumer rates are competitive with or better than Big Five banks. The SFG will publish these comparisons publicly. Credit unions that fail to demonstrate customer benefit may have their SFG access suspended.

The SFG will cover balance transfer fees for Saskatchewan residents moving their primary banking from a Big Five bank to a participating credit union. The SFG will also work with credit unions to offer streamlined mortgage transfers for Saskatchewan residents, covering appraisal fees and legal costs for qualifying transfers. 

Participating credit unions must offer a basic no-fee chequing account with no minimum balance. The SFG will provide credit unions with a per-account subsidy for the first two years to offset the cost of free accounts.

The SFG will be mandated to maintain liquidity sufficient for daily Credit Union operations, as well as purchase investment instruments, including Provincial Treasury Bills or Bonds to manage liquidity and support provincial financing. 

The SFG will be prohibited from funding or investing in any and all fossil fuel, tobacco, weapons, or other morally questionable industries.

Credit Unions would also have access to an SFG developed, world-class, secure, digital banking platform, built in partnership with the Saskatchewan Digital Services (SDS). This would allow Credit Unions to easily, using standard tools, produce their own apps and websites to give their members the modern online banking services they've come to expect without exorbitant vendor fees.

	See Policy 16 - Digital Sovereignty for more. 

The SFG will operate in coordination with the Credit Union Deposit Guarantee Corporation, which maintains its existing regulatory and deposit insurance functions. The CUDGC's board representation on SFG ensures alignment between liquidity support and prudential regulation.

SFG funding to credit unions will be secured against loan portfolios or other assets. In the event of a credit union failure, the CUDGC maintains its deposit guarantee function, and SFG claims will be subordinate to depositor protection. The SFG will maintain prudent exposure limits to any single credit union.

#### The Funding

The funding for operating the SSFA and the SSF will come from using 1% of the interest payments for administration and operating costs. 

The funding for operating the SFG will come from General Revenues, offset by investment returns. 

#### What It Means For You

It means Provincial cash stays in the Province. 

It means Saskatchewan Credit Unions can compete and win.

It means the dignity of knowing our future is secured.
