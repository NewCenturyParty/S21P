# Detailed Policy 

#### The Problem

Saskatchewan is not taking advantage of the resources available to it. 

#### The Promise

The NCP will capture the future resources sector ensuring the benefits go to the people, and will modernize power grids and power generation to meet the needs of the 21st Century. 

#### The Plan

The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Sovereignty Act and amendments to the Power Corporation Act. Together this will allow Saskatchewan to have the resources and power be built and extracted by the people and for the people. 

The Act will mandate for all new or expanded major resource development projects in Saskatchewan, the province reserves the right to purchase a majority equity working interest stake of no less than 66%, at audited cost to date, with back-in rights. Half of the Government's purchase must by law be immediately sold at audited cost to a collective trust owned and operated by all Treaty Nations, First Nations, and Métis, governing bodies of Saskatchewan.

All new major or newly expanded resource projects must be trilaterally co-owned by the Provincial Crown, the Sovereign Treaty and First Nations as a collective, and any private company interested in partnership, should there be any. It will be a trilateral co-ownership model, where ownership and profit will be split three ways: 33% - 33% - 33%. 

- 33% of the project shall be owned by the Government of Saskatchewan, and they will have a veto over the project. 
- 33% of the project shall be owned by the Treaty nations of Saskatchewan, and they will have a veto over the project. 
- 33% of the project shall be owned by the company, and they will not have a veto on the project. 
- The final 1% of the project shall owned by and held in trust, co-owned by all stakeholders, with payments exclusively used for maintenance and upkeep costs of the project.

Existing resource operations will continue under current agreements until lease renewal or significant expansion, at which point the trilateral model will apply. In the interim, royalty rates for existing operations will be increased to ensure fair public return.

The trilateral ownership model applies to all non-renewable resource extraction, including potash, uranium, lithium, rare earths, and other minerals. Existing potash operations will continue under current agreements, with the trilateral model applying to any new mines or significant expansions.

This is about true partnership, equality, and co-government with the Sovereigns, the Treaty Nations and First Nations who have always called this place home. The Corporations are considered to be valuable, but voluntary, partners in Saskatchewan Resources. They will not have a veto or be able to dictate final terms for the Province or Sovereigns. Should they not agree to the 33% stake, they will forfeit their share, which will be divided evenly to the Province and Sovereigns for a 50 / 50 split. Other ways for corporations to forfeit their share include:

- The corporation explicitly declines in writing to proceed with development.
- The corporation fails to meet capital calls within 90 days notice.
- The corporation votes against a project that Crown and Nations both approve.
- The corporation attempts to sell to a buyer Crown/Nations reject.

The Treaty Nations Resource Trust will be governed by a board with representation from all participating Treaty areas and Métis governance bodies, with decision-making processes determined by the participating Nations. The Province will provide capacity funding to establish the Trust's governance structure, with final authority resting with Indigenous leadership.

Decision-making processes within the Treaty Nations Resource Trust will be determined by participating Indigenous governments. The Province commits to working with whatever governance structure the Nations establish.

While this is a 67% haircut to the corporations, it also saves millions in litigation, protest delays, and a 66% immediate return on CAPEX for exploration and initial costs. It means if we all respect each other, things can happen quickly. 

Also introduced in this Act is a Value-Add Levy that increases the costs of shipping specified raw resources, like Uranium (Yellowcake) and more to determined by regulation, to encourage local refinement over shipping raw products. 

The Value-Add Levy will be set at rates that make raw export economically uncompetitive with domestic processing. Initial rates will be determined by regulation following consultation with industry, with the goal of ensuring that processing Saskatchewan uranium into fuel pellets in Saskatchewan is always more profitable than exporting yellowcake.

A steep, escalating Dormant Lease Tax will be applied to mineral leases held for speculative purposes without active development plans.

The Dormant Lease Tax will begin at $50 per hectare in year one of inactivity, escalating to $100 in year two and $200 in year three. Leases inactive for three consecutive years will revert to the Crown unless the leaseholder demonstrates a bona fide development plan approved by the Ministry.

Water resources are excluded from the trilateral model. All water rights and water-related projects will be jointly managed by the Provincial Crown and Treaty Nations, with no private ownership or corporate participation permitted. 

<strong><u>The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Corporation (SNRC):</u></strong>

The Act will establish a new Crown corporation to be known as the Saskatchewan Natural Resources Corporation (SNRC), with a mandate to set up and operate new or expanded major resource projects in direct partnership with industry and local Indigenous governing bodies, communities and organizations.They will be the representative of the Crown for the 33 - 33 - 33 trilateral ownership split. 

The SNRC will prioritize building new mines and other non-renewable resource extraction projects in the province. The SNRC will lead development of all new non-fossil fuel resource projects This means opening new mines and reopening or expanding older mines, all of which will be subject to the new trilateral ownership model. The main priority will be Uranium mining and refinement. 

To reiterate, the SNRC is prohibited from initiating new fossil fuel projects. However, under Policy 13 - Climate Crossroads, the SNRC may serve as operator of last resort for existing fossil fuel assets transferred to provincial control during the managed sunset of the industry.

The SNRC is mandated partner to with the Saskatchewan Manufacturing Corporation (SMC) to build a Mine to Uranium Refinery and Fuel Fabrication Facility track in Saskatchewan. The goal is a total verticalization of the uranium power industry in Saskatchewan. Instead of only simply shipping out yellowcake (Uranium Dirt that is literally yellow) we will make the fuel pellets and rods in Saskatchewan. This fuel will be used to power SaskPower's CANDU reactors, with excess fuel and electrons being sold to the market. 

The Uranium Refinery and Fuel Fabrication Facility will be operational within 10 years, with phased construction beginning within the first term. Initial CANDU reactors may use imported fuel until domestic fabrication capacity is established.

	See Policy 19 - Manufacturing for more. 

The SNRC board must be composed of no less than 50% representation from Saskatchewan Indigenous governing bodies. All new or expanded resource projects will be mandated to be exclusively unionized for every stage of construction and operation. 

A major resource project is defined as any extraction, processing, or related infrastructure project with estimated capital costs exceeding $25 million or projected annual revenues exceeding $10 million. Thresholds will be reviewed every five years and adjusted for inflation.

All SNRC projects will be exclusively unionized workplaces. The SNRC will prioritize hiring from local Indigenous communities and will work with unions to ensure Indigenous workers have expedited pathways to union membership and apprenticeship programs.

All SNRC projects will meet or exceed federal environmental assessment requirements and will incorporate Indigenous environmental knowledge in project design and monitoring.

<strong><u>SaskPower:</u></strong> 

SaskPower will be mandated to modernize and increase generation for the entire electrical grid to be able to withstand the needs of the 21st century. 

The new grid must be able to withstand extreme weather, be it prolonged or acute events. The grid must be able to sustain large-scale EV charging. SaskPower will install EV and eBike charging stations in multiple convenient locations throughout communities across Saskatchewan.

The entire grid must be layered within other grids, like neighbourhood micro grids, municipal grids, and local or regional grids with a larger provincial grid, to ensure there is no single point of failure.

Grid modernization will be the largest infrastructure investment in SaskPower's history, funded through SaskBonds and phased over 15-20 years. Detailed cost estimates will be developed within the first year and updated annually.

Critical infrastructure must have islandable power.

	See Policy - 20 Disaster Resilience.

SaskPower must begin the process of building a Virtual Power Plant. A new rate class will be created alongside the technology platform to link household solar, batteries, EVs, and other smart appliances, into a unified grid asset. 

Those who sign up to join the VPP will be offered a no money down, sliding scale, on bill repayment plan for the following residential or business upgrades:

- New, ultra efficient, electrified household or business appliances.
- New roof top solar panels and household or industrial battery packs. 
- All new appliances, heat pumps, or solar panels and batteries must be installed as to be easily upgradable as the technology develops and matures. 

Those who sign up to be part of the VPP will have their solar and battery storage, and potentially other smart appliances, connected to the grid, which can then use that power to stabilize power draw throughout the province, especially during emergencies. Any power used from household power will be credited on bill to the electricity provider. 

SaskPower must immediately begin expansion of its energy generation. There will be Solar Farms and Wind Farms built and maintained throughout the province wherever they can be most efficient and useful. 

The bulk of the new power generation will come from a new fleet of modern CANDU nuclear reactors. These reactors will be built and operated throughout the province, providing new, clean, and abundant baseload power. 

SaskPower will develop a Nuclear Expansion Plan within 24 months, with an initial target of 4-6 CANDU reactors over 20 years, subject to demand projections, grid capacity, and financing availability. Additional reactors may be added as export demand from MISO and neighbouring provinces materializes.

Expanding export capacity to MISO will require significant transmission infrastructure investment and cross-border regulatory agreements. SaskPower will begin preliminary interconnection studies and discussions with MISO and relevant US regulators within the first term.

Export agreements with neighbouring provinces will be structured to support regional energy security while generating revenue for Saskatchewan.

Nuclear facility licensing falls under federal jurisdiction through the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The Province will work cooperatively with federal regulators while asserting Saskatchewan's constitutional authority over electricity generation and resource development.

Reactor siting will be determined through a transparent process including environmental assessment, community consultation, and free, prior, and informed consent from affected Indigenous communities.

To reiterate, we will be using CANDU reactors, burning our own unenriched uranium. There will be no proliferation in Saskatchewan. And, a bonus with CANDU reactors is it allows us to create medical isotopes for various treatments, including cancer treatment. We will flood the market with these isotopes to bring the price down, and help cure disease cheaply. 

These new reactors will use fuel fabricated in Saskatchewan at the Uranium Refinery and Fuel Fabrication Facility built by the SNRC and SMC.

#### The Funding 

The primary upfront funding for these major projects will come from SaskBond revenues and funding from the General Revenue Fund for daily operations. 

Ongoing funding for the SNRC will come from its share of profits from resource projects, and ongoing funding for SaskPower will come from its revenues.

Costs will be offset by the Dormant Lease Levy on speculative mineral leases, as well as the lower operating costs of modern power generation and a more efficient grid.

#### What It Means For You

It means the Saskatchewan resident benefits from Saskatchewan resources.

It means power outages are a thing of the past. 

It means the dignity in powering the province ourselves.

# FAQ

- What is the trilateral ownership model?
	- All new or expanded major resource projects must be co-owned three ways: 33% by the Government of Saskatchewan, 33% by the Treaty Nations of Saskatchewan collectively, and 33% by the private company. Both the Province and Treaty Nations have a veto; the corporation does not.

- What happens if a company refuses the 33% stake?
	- They forfeit their share, which is divided evenly between the Province and Treaty Nations for a 50/50 split.

- Does this apply to existing mines?
	- Existing resource operations continue under current agreements until lease renewal or significant expansion, at which point the trilateral model applies. In the interim, royalty rates will be increased.

- What is the SNRC?
	- The Saskatchewan Natural Resources Corporation is a new Crown corporation that operates resource projects in partnership with industry and Indigenous governing bodies. It prioritizes uranium mining and refinement and is prohibited from initiating new fossil fuel projects.

- Why CANDU reactors?
	- CANDU reactors use unenriched uranium, which Saskatchewan already produces. There is no proliferation risk, and as a bonus they produce medical isotopes for cancer treatment and diagnostics.

- What is the Virtual Power Plant?
	- A network that links household solar panels, batteries, EVs, and smart appliances into a unified grid asset. Those who sign up get $0 upfront installations and earn credits for any power the grid draws from their home.

- What is the Dormant Lease Tax?
	- A steep, escalating tax on mineral leases held for speculative purposes without active development. Leases inactive for three consecutive years revert to the Crown unless a bona fide development plan is approved.
