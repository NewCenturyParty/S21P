<h1 align="center">The Saskatchewan 21 Policies (S21P)</h1>

> <p align="center"><strong>21 Policies for a 21st Century Saskatchewan.</strong></p>

## Welcome

This repository houses the source material for every policy in the New Century Party platform. Each folder corresponds to one of the 21 policies and contains research notes, early drafts, and accessories that eventually feed the public website and campaign materials.

We build in the open. If you are new to GitHub or contribution workflows, this guide explains everything you need to start making meaningful edits.

--- 

## Repository Structure

- `01_Human_Dignity` through `21_Funding` – Working spaces for each policy. Use these folders for research, draft narratives, tables, and references.
- `README.md` – You are here. Contribution guidance and project orientation.

We follow plain-text first. Markdown (`.md`) or simple text files are preferred. Please avoid binary formats unless absolutely necessary.

## Contribution Overview

Policy work moves through four stages:

1. **Explore** – Read the existing notes in the policy folder and review the public summary on the [NCP website](../Sites/NCP-website/webpages/21policies.html).
2. **Draft** – Create or edit Markdown files in the relevant folder. Keep changes scoped to one policy per pull request.
3. **Discuss** – Open or join GitHub Issues for open questions, cite sources, and flag trade-offs.
4. **Review** – Submit a pull request (PR), receive feedback, and iterate until the changes are approved.

Everything is version-controlled so the history of a policy’s development stays transparent and auditable.

## Pull Request (PR) Workflow

> A pull request is a formal way to propose merging your changes into the main project. Think of it as “Here’s what I changed, can we add it?”

### 1. Fork or Branch

- **If you have write access:** create a feature branch off `main` (e.g., `git checkout -b policy-07-harm-reduction`).
- **If you do not have write access:** fork the repository via GitHub, then clone your fork locally.

### 2. Make Focused Changes

- Work inside the relevant policy folder.
- Include citations, links, or data sources in your draft.
- Run spell or grammar checks if possible.

### 3. Commit Convention

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
git commit -m "07 Public Safety: add sobering center program details"
```

### 4. Open a Pull Request

When you push your branch, GitHub will prompt you to “Compare & pull request.” In your PR description, include:

- **Summary:** What you changed and why.
- **Policy Impact:** Which policy number(s) are affected.
- **Verification:** How you validated the change (sources, calculations, etc.).
- **Open Questions:** Anything reviewers should focus on.

### 5. Review and Merge

At least one reviewer must approve. They may request revisions or provide suggestions. Once consensus is reached, a maintainer merges the PR.

If you are new to PRs, more detailed instructions are available in [GitHub’s “About pull requests” docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

---

## Style Expectations

- **Plain language first.** Write as though you are explaining the policy to a neighbour.
- **Citations.** Link to credible sources (legislation, reports, data). Note them inline or in a short references section.
- **Structure.** Use headings, bullet lists, and tables to keep documents scannable.
- **Version notes.** If you change numbers or targets, note the date and assumption updates.

## CodeShare Civics

CodeShare Civics is the democratic workflow we are prototyping for Saskatchewan. Think of it as Git for governance:

- **Open Branches:** Draft regulations, policies, or legislation live in branches that anyone can inspect.
- **Pull Requests as Petitions:** Residents submit proposals (PRs). When enough verified residents support a PR, the relevant ministry must respond.
- **Transparent Logs:** Every commit is traceable back to an author with timestamps, ensuring accountability.
- **Canonical Mirrors:** The future `git.saskatchewan.ca` will mirror the official gazette. Any discrepancy must be reconciled within 14 days with a public explanation.
- **Accessibility:** Interfaces must support screen readers, multiple languages, and dark mode.

By contributing here, you are helping define how that system could work in practice: open deliberation, accountable decision-making, and a permanent public record.

## Getting Help

- **Open an Issue:** Ask clarifying questions, propose new research tasks, or flag blockers.
- **Join Discussions:** Review existing issues before filing a new one to avoid duplication.
- **Direct Contact:** Email the party at [newcenturyparty@icloud.com](mailto:newcenturyparty@icloud.com) if you’re unsure where to start.

Whether you are writing your first sentence or refining an entire policy, we are grateful. These policies belong to everyone who shows up to build them.
