# Detailed Policy 


### The Problem

Cities are held back by old ways of thinking that are not compatible with Human Thriving. 

Our infrastructure is nearing its replacement age.

There are no reliable transit options between communities across the province.

### The Promise

An NCP Government will ensure our cities meet the standards of the 21st Century and that transportation between communities is reliable, frequent, and cheap. 

### The Plan 

The NCP will introduce amendments to:

- The SaskEnergy Act
- The Saskatchewan Telecommunications Act. 
- The Municipalities Act
- The Construction Codes Act
- and more

<u><strong>SaskEnergy - From Gas Utility to Thermal Utility </u></strong>

SaskEnergy will be given a new mandate to rapidly transition from purely gas utility, to a Thermal Utility. They will offer gas as a backup, but going forward they will use geothermal heating to heat, and cool, homes by placing 5th Generation Ambient Loops underneath city streets, parks, parkades, etc.

5th Generation Ambient loops are filled with a water solution and uses the Earth's natural heat underground so they remain a constant stable, and warm, temperature. Inside each house a hydronic heat pump will be installed to take the heat from the ambient loops and, through compression, generate more than enough heat for any size of home. In the summer it works in reverse, the heat pump takes the heat from the house and pumps it back into the ambient loops. 

The in home infrastructure, like heat pumps, will be offered as a $0 upfront, 30 year, on bill repayment. The monthly thermal bill will be, by law, no more expensive than the 5-year rolling average of gas heating costs for a comparable home in the same region. Repayment obligations attach to the property and transfer with ownership.

Gas heating will remain a service and optional hook up for the next 50 years, to ensure there is more than enough time to build and install new infrastructure in home and underground. While the ambient loops will provide more than enough heat, even in -40 degree weather, the gas will still be there for peace of mind just in case.

SaskEnergy will also explore additional heat sources for ambient loops such as vertical geothermal boreholes beneath large public spaces, roads, parking lots, etc, and other geothermal power and heat capture opportunities. 

For rural properties where connection to ambient loops is not feasible, SaskEnergy will offer ground-source heat pump installations with the same $0 upfront, on-bill repayment terms.

The goal is that it will all be interconnected. The waste heat from the fridges in the grocery store could be heating the nearby apartments. And to be clear, everyone will have their own thermostat and heat pump. People will control their own individual household temperatures just like now. It will just be extremely efficient and cheap. 

<u><strong>SaskTel - Connected the Community Digitally</u></strong>

SaskTel will be mandated to ensure affordable, high-speed, fibre option internet is available to every household and farm in Saskatchewan. The rollout must be completed with the next 5 years of the mandate coming into force.

<u><strong>SaskPower - Power to the People</u></strong>

SaskPower will be mandated to modernize the entire electrical grid to be able to withstand the needs of the 21st century. This includes vast amounts of new power generation, and upgrades to ensure power lines to withstand storms, and increased energy production.

	See Policy 15 - Energy and Resource Sovereignty for more.

<strong><u>Dig Once:</u></strong>

All digging needed for the new infrastructure done by SaskEnergy, SaskTel, SaskPower, and the municipalities must be coordinated to follow a "Dig Once" policy as to minimize the disturbance to the public. We won't tear up the street multiple times a decade anymore. 

<u><strong>Municipalities - Human Centred Cities</u></strong>

The Municipalities Act will be amended and modernized, allowing our municipalities the opportunity to grow and thrive in the 21st Century. Negotiations with the municipalities of Saskatchewan will begin immediately. The NCP will listen to what they need to make the best places to live possible. 

Municipalities will be mandated to create Priority Housing Zones around priority areas designated by the province, such as downtowns, transit corridors, schools, main streets, hospitals, with as-of-right approvals for SaskHomes and Provincial Standard Plans. These PHZs must cover at least 35% of total municipal zoning. 

PHZs will allow most construction as by-right should they meet new provincial standard plans and universal design standards made in consultation with the community. Meaning that unless a real objection is made for legitimate code and safety reasons, the project will move forward as deemed approved. Housing is a human right and we must act with the urgency that necessitates. 

Gated communities or any developments that restrict movement between neighbourhoods will be strictly prohibited. The free passage throughout the city is paramount. 

Cities must adopt a human first approach, ensuring that anyone can reliably get the services and items needed for human thriving and dignity within a short walk. Cars will not be restricted, but they can no longer be prioritized exclusively. Proper, protected, bike lanes must be made to allow for cheap and easy travel through any city. 

Municipalities will be mandated to remove and replace the lead and asbestos pipes. They must coordinate the work of digging up streets and replacing these pipes with the other Crown corporations mentioned in this policy to ensure that the "Dig Once" policy is met.

Grants and logistical help will be offered by the province to any municipality that adopts any of the following:

- Transit Improvements
	- Longer service hours.
	- More frequent and reliable service.
	- Extra grants for those that build new trams / street cars. 
- Walkable Cities
	- Designing networks and communities so that 90% of residents are within a 10-20 minute walk of the following key amenities:
		- Grocery Stores.
		- Primary Care.
		- Primary and Secondary School.
		- Childcare.
		- Parks and Green Spaces.
		- Frequent Transit stops.
		- Public Libraries and Maker Spaces.
- Street standards
	- Protected Bike Lanes wherever possible. 
	- Traffic Calming Street Designs.
	- Close school zone streets to through-traffic during certain hours.
	- Tree Canopy Coverage targets.
	- Safe crossings and intersection redesigns. 
- Parking Reform
	- Remove Parking minimums.
- Zoning Reform
	- Gradually eliminate Single Family Zoning.
	- Allow for mixed use development.
	- Allow missing middle housing.
	- Allow storefront main floors with housing units above.

<strong><u>Reviving the STC</u></strong> 

A "new" Crown corp named the Saskatchewan Transport Company (STC) will be established. This STC is reimagined as a public logistics, package, freight, as well as a personal transport company.

The STC will custom order buses that have cold storage sections in the back half of the bus. This will allow for the transport of goods, like groceries for SaskGrocery, or medical supplies, in addition to regular freight, packages, and the people on the bus. By moving people and goods at the same time we make the STC viable. 

	See Policy 14 - Food Sovereignty for more.

The service will connect any community of over 1000 people on a regular AM / PM basis, with more service provided for heavily used routes. 

STC Depots will be constructed around the province. Each depot will act as a Resilience Hub, and as a cold storage hub and a package / freight pickup and drop off centre. Cold Storage Lockers will be available 24/7 for online ordered grocery pick up for rural communities. The idea is you order in the app, and pick fresh groceries up within 24 hours at the locker. 

The STC will partner with local businesses and other Crown companies as its main source of business of cheap logistic travel across the province. The expected primary customers of this new STC are:

- The Saskatchewan public looking for transit between their communities. 
- SaskGrocery to deliver groceries and supplies between stores across the province. 
- Pharmacies to deliver prescriptions across the province.
- Business or individuals looking to ship items or freight inter-provincially.

A project for a True High-Speed Rail line between Regina and Saskatoon will be established with serious planning, corridor protection, and feasibility work beginning within immediately.

### The Funding

SaskBonds Infrastructure Series along with Municipal Bonds will pay for the street upgrades, the geothermal ambient loops, and other infrastructure upgrades. Cost sharing agreements will be made with the municipalities. 

	See Policy 05 - Housing Crisis for more. 
	See Policy 21 - Funding for more. 

Ongoing operating costs supported by things like thermal tariffs, electricity rates, and internet service revenues.

Net revenues over time will help support maintenance, operations, and further expansion as need and demand grows. 

### What It Means For You

It means no more dangerous combustibles inside your home.

It means your communities are connected.

It means the dignity in daring to build better, together.

# FAQ

- What is a 5th Generation Ambient Loop?
	- It is a network of underground pipes filled with a water solution that uses the Earth's natural geothermal heat. In winter, a heat pump in your home draws warmth from the loop. In summer, it works in reverse, pulling heat from your home and sending it back underground. It is extremely efficient and works even in -40 degree weather.

- Will I still have gas heating?
	- Yes. Gas heating will remain available as a backup and optional hook-up for the next 50 years. The ambient loop will be the primary heating source, but gas will still be there for peace of mind.

- Will I control my own thermostat?
	- Absolutely. Everyone will have their own thermostat and heat pump. You control your household temperature just like now. It will just be much cheaper and more efficient.

- How much will the in-home equipment cost me?
	- The in-home infrastructure like heat pumps will be offered at $0 upfront with a 30-year on-bill repayment. Your monthly thermal bill will, by law, be no more expensive than the 5-year rolling average of gas heating costs for a comparable home.

- What about rural properties?
	- For rural properties where connection to ambient loops is not feasible, SaskEnergy will offer ground-source heat pump installations with the same $0 upfront, on-bill repayment terms.

- What is the "Dig Once" policy?
	- All digging needed for new infrastructure by SaskEnergy, SaskTel, SaskPower, and municipalities must be coordinated so streets are not torn up multiple times. One dig, everything goes in.

- Is the STC the same as the old Saskatchewan Transportation Company?
	- It is reimagined. The new STC moves both people and goods at the same time, with buses that have cold storage sections for groceries, medical supplies, and freight. It connects any community of over 1,000 people on a regular basis.

- Will there be high-speed rail?
	- Serious planning, corridor protection, and feasibility work for a True High-Speed Rail line between Regina and Saskatoon will begin immediately.
