# Detailed Policy

### The Problem

As affordability worsens, people become more and more desperate. 

### The Promise

The NCP will treat addictions not as moral failing, but as the health crisis that it is. 

The NCP will treat the unhoused not as a nuisance but as government failure. 

And the NCP will ensure the right people are sent for the right circumstances.

### The Plan 

The NCP transform Saskatchewan's public safety system to be in line with a health-first, dignity-first model. 

Amendments will be made existing laws as to address three key areas that will make our communities safer.


<strong><u>Houselessness:</u></strong>

The NCP commits to a housing first solution. The Ministry of Social Services will be instructed to create a single coordinated case list to find and qualify houseless people, with manageable caseloads for the social workers as to ensure clients do not get thrown around. The Ministry will work directly with the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation, and together they will ensure priority placements for the unhoused, those living in encampments, and those escaping domestic violence, into newly renovated or acquired public housing. 

New supportive housing developments will be created and operated in partnership with existing supportive housing organizations to ensure housing placement is just the first step in a healing journey. We won't just toss people with complex needs into a home and abandon them. 

Housing encampments cannot be disbanded unless there are real placements for the people and their property. This means a private room and secure storage with transport to get there. Encampment residents will be given first priority placements into new SHC units as they become available in the city the encampment is placed. No one will be forced into moving to a new town away from their supports. 

<strong><u>Addictions:</u></strong>

Addictions are a health matter and we will treat the addictions crisis as the health crisis it is. As such, involuntary addictions treatment will be abolished in Saskatchewan. Treatment must be based on consent, evidence, and dignity.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority will open and operate voluntary 24/7 Addictions and Sobering Centres. Centres will be established to ensure no Saskatchewan resident is more than one hour from a facility, with locations in Regina, Saskatoon, Prince Albert, and additional regional centres as determined by need. Each centre will offer same day and outpatient detox treatments, like Opioid Agonist Therapy (OAT). Each centre will also include supervised consumption services, with specific service models and locations determined by the Saskatchewan Health Authority in consultation with local communities and people with lived experience. 

Warm hand offs to the Ministry of Social Services for housing and other supports will always be offered so that no one leaves empty handed. Naloxone will be offered for free, no questions asked, at any time. All services will be free, as part of the Universal Health Plan.

	See Policy 03 - Universal Health for more.

The Government of Saskatchewan will work with the Federal government and Health Canada to decriminalize small personal possession of illicit drugs, seeking a Saskatchewan-wide exemption so that federal law matches a health-first approach. Thresholds for personal possession will be determined by regulation in consultation with health experts and law enforcement. Addiction is not a crime and we should not be treating it as such.

First responders will be instructed to focus on overdose prevention and connection to care, and will not automatically seize small amounts of substances for personal use unless there is an immediate safety concern, such as risk to children. However, decriminalization does not mean public use. Should someone be found with illicit drugs by first responders, they will be instructed to take the individual to a 24/7 Addictions and Sobering Centre to either sober up or consume the substance safely under clinician supervision. 

Provincially regulated police services will be instructed, where there is no public safety risk, to treat simple possession of small amounts of illicit substances for personal use as their lowest priority issue. Instead, officers will be expected to issue warnings, provide referrals or health-based responses, and focus on enforcement on trafficking, exploitation, and serious violence instead. 

All provincially regulated or certified first aid equipment kits must contain overdose reversal medications like naloxone.

<strong><u>First Responders:</u></strong>

The Saskatchewan Marshals will be disbanded. Their funding will be redirected to a new team of first responders called Community Crisis Officers (CCOs). This will allow cops to be cops again, not social workers who waste their policing time waiting in hospitals for a release form. 

These Community Crisis Officers (CCOs) will be managed by the Ministry of Health as well as the Saskatchewan Health Authority, and will be made up of professionals such as:

- Mental health workers.
- Social workers.
- Paramedics.
- Peer support workers with lived experience.

New provincial dispatch standards and agreements will be made to ensure that 911 dispatchers can triage calls by risk and need. Mental health crises, intoxication, welfare checks, and similar 911 calls will be directed to the Community Crisis Officer's first, before police. Police will instead be dispatched to higher-risk calls, or when specifically requested to accompany Community Crisis Officers, or other first responders, should they feel there is any safety risk at all.

New standards will be made in partnership with the police and their unions to strengthen public trust. All police officers in Saskatchewan will be duty bound by law to clear de-escalation requirements with a duty to intervene when a colleague is escalating a situation unnecessarily. Militarized equipment will continue to be restricted to properly trained Emergency Response Teams (ERT) under strict rules, never to be used for routine policing. Random street checks or carding will be prohibited and police will be required for any and all stops to collect stop-level data and publish it every quarter. This data must include:

- Age
- Race (self reported)
- Indigenous Status (as defined in the Statistics Canada Census)
- Outcome
- Context of the stop
- And additional factors as determined by regulation

All police officers will receive ongoing training in de-escalation, trauma-informed response, and anti-racism, with training standards developed in partnership with police services and community organizations.

The Province will work with, rural municipalities, First Nations governments and Tribal Councils to develop culturally appropriate crisis response and addictions services, respecting rural limitations, Indigenous jurisdiction and supporting Indigenous-led healing approaches. Funding will be provided for on-reserve crisis response capacity where requested by rural and First Nations leadership. 

### The Funding

The new mobile crisis first responders, Community Crisis Officers, will be funded through both the Universal Health Levy as part of the budget for mental health and community care, and the existing budget allocated to the now-disbanded Saskatchewan Marshals. The 24/7 Addictions Centres will also be funded through the Universal Health Levy.

	See Policy 03 - Universal Health for more. 

Everyday policing and public safety funding will continue to come from the General Revenue Fund, with a shift in priorities to health-first and community-based responses. 

### What It Means For You

It means power comes with responsibility.

It means we have a duty to help one another.

It means safety in Saskatchewan.

# FAQ

- What happens to the Saskatchewan Marshals?
	- They will be disbanded. Their funding will be redirected to a new team of first responders called Community Crisis Officers (CCOs), managed by the Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority.

- What are Community Crisis Officers?
	- CCOs are teams of mental health workers, social workers, paramedics, and peer support workers with lived experience. They respond to mental health crises, intoxication, welfare checks, and similar calls before police are dispatched.

- Does decriminalization mean drugs are legal?
	- No. Decriminalization means small personal possession would not result in criminal charges. It does not mean public use is permitted. If someone is found with a small amount for personal use, first responders will take them to a 24/7 Addictions and Sobering Centre to consume safely or sober up under clinical supervision.

- Will involuntary addictions treatment continue?
	- No. Involuntary addictions treatment will be abolished. Treatment must be based on consent, evidence, and dignity.

- Will police still respond to emergencies?
	- Yes. Police will continue to be dispatched to higher-risk calls. The change is that mental health crises, welfare checks, and similar calls will go to CCOs first. Police can always be called in if there is a safety risk.

- What about housing for people living in encampments?
	- Encampments cannot be disbanded unless there are real placements available, meaning a private room and secure storage with transport. Residents will be given first priority placements into new public housing units in their city.
