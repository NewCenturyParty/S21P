# Policy 21 — Funding the Future: A Fully Costed 20-Year Fiscal Framework for the Saskatchewan 21 Policies

> We all pay our fair share to share in a fair society.

---

## Part I — The Fiscal Philosophy

The Saskatchewan 21 Policies represent the most ambitious provincial platform in Canadian history. They demand an equally ambitious and transparent funding model. This policy is the keystone that holds the other twenty together. Every dollar of new spending identified below is matched to a revenue source, a bond instrument, a Crown Corporation return, or an economic feedback mechanism. Where gaps exist, they are stated openly.

The fiscal philosophy of the NCP rests on five principles:

1. **Honesty.** The public deserves to see every assumption, every risk, and every trade-off. This document hides nothing.
2. **Investment, not Expense.** The vast majority of new spending creates productive assets, builds human capital, or generates revenue streams that compound over time. We are planting trees whose shade we will sit in.
3. **Velocity of Money.** Money that stays and circulates in Saskatchewan generates more wealth than money extracted to distant shareholders. The SFG, credit unions, Crown Corporations, and SaskBonds are designed to keep the circular flow of dollars within our borders.
4. **Intergenerational Equity.** The Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund ensures that resource wealth is saved and invested for future generations, not consumed today. Bond-funded capital projects spread costs across the decades of benefit they deliver.
5. **Fiscal Sustainability.** The platform phases in over 4-8 years. Early deficits are structural investments. By Year 10-12, the economy is substantially larger, Crown Corporations are generating returns, and the SSF is contributing meaningfully from interest. By Year 15-20, the system approaches a dynamic fiscal balance.

### Baseline Context

Saskatchewan's current (2025-26) fiscal position is approximately:

| Item | Amount ($M) |
|---|---|
| Total Provincial Revenue | ~$20,000 |
| Personal Income Tax | ~$3,500 |
| Corporate Income Tax | ~$1,100 |
| Provincial Sales Tax (6%) | ~$3,000 |
| Other Tax Revenue | ~$3,400 |
| Resource Royalties | ~$2,500 |
| Federal Transfers | ~$3,000 |
| Crown Dividends | ~$1,500 |
| Other Revenue | ~$2,000 |
| **Total Spending** | **~$20,000** |
| Health | ~$7,500 |
| Education | ~$4,000 |
| Social Services | ~$1,500 |
| Infrastructure & Transport | ~$1,500 |
| All Other | ~$5,500 |

Population: ~1,220,000. GDP: ~$95 billion. Employed persons: ~580,000.

The S21P platform will approximately double the size of the provincial operating budget at full implementation, offset by approximately $8-12 billion in new annual revenues and substantial economic growth that broadens the tax base over time.

## Part II — Revenue Framework

### A. Tax Revenue Reforms

#### 1. Provincial Sales Tax (PST) Increase

The PST will increase from 6% to 7%, effective the first full fiscal year.

| Year | Rate | Estimated Annual Revenue Gain ($M) |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 7% | ~$500 |
| Year 5 | 7% | ~$590 |
| Year 10 | 7% | ~$680 |
| Year 20 | 7% | ~$900 |

Revenue grows with nominal consumer spending. 20-year cumulative: ~$13.5 billion.

#### 2. Personal Income Tax (PIT) Reform

All existing bracket rates increase by +1.5 percentage points. Two new high-income brackets are created. All thresholds indexed annually to Saskatchewan CPI.

| Taxable Income | Current Rate | New Rate | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0 – $53,462 | 10.5% | 12.0% | +1.5% |
| $53,462 – $99,287 | 12.5% | 14.0% | +1.5% |
| $99,287 – $200,000 | 14.5% | 16.0% | +1.5% |
| $200,000 – $500,000 | 14.5% | 16.5% | +2.0% |
| $500,000+ | 14.5% | 17.0% | +2.5% |

**New Non-Refundable Dignity Tax Credit:** Fully offsets provincial PIT on the Dignity Dividend for incomes under $50,000. Phases out between $50,000 and $100,000. Fully taxable above $100,000.

**Priority Professional Tax Credit:** New tax credits for priority professions (physicians, nurses, educators, etc.), to be determined in consultation with relevant unions and boards.

Estimated annual revenue gain: ~$950M at full implementation (Year 2+), growing to ~$1.5B by Year 20 with bracket creep and economic growth.

**METR Safeguard:** The Minister of Finance must annually publish combined Marginal Effective Tax Rate (METR) curves. METR must not exceed 55% across the SDD phase-out range ($50,000–$100,000). If METR exceeds 55%, corrective measures must be tabled within 60 days. Published with the annual budget.

#### 3. Corporate / Co-operative Income Tax Reform

| Business Limit | Current Rate | New Rate | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0 – $600,000* | 1% | 1% | 0% |
| $600,000 – $1,200,000* | 12% | 12% | 0% |
| $1,200,000 – $10,000,000 | 12% | 13% | +1.0% |
| $10,000,000+ | 12% | 14% | +2.0% |

*Small business rate preserved to protect small enterprises and co-operatives.*

**Associated/Related Entities:** Corporations under common control are aggregated for bracket purposes. Anti-fragmentation rules apply where entities share premises, systems, branding, management, or have >25% intra-group revenue. A provincial GAAR applies to arrangements with the primary purpose of accessing lower brackets.

Qualifications for Associated/Related Entity status:
- Same 4-digit NAICS code
- Shared branding, website, phone, advertising, or common loyalty program
- Shared premises or equipment
- Mostly shared employees or management
- More than 25% intra-group revenue
- Centralized pricing, booking, POS, or back office

Businesses that are distinct with separate premises, staff, and branding are not aggregated.

Estimated annual revenue gain: ~$180M at full implementation, growing to ~$300M by Year 20.

#### 4. Dignity Dividend Tax Clawback

The Dignity Dividend is taxable income. For earners above $100,000, it is fully taxable at their marginal rate. The graduated phase-out between $50,000 and $100,000 generates an effective partial clawback. Approximately 20-25% of gross SDD expenditure is recovered through the tax system.

Estimated annual clawback recovery: ~$1.2 billion (Year 2+), growing with CPI indexation to ~$1.6B by Year 20.

20-year cumulative tax clawback: ~$27 billion.

### B. Universal Health Levy (UHL)

See Policy 03 — Universal Health.

A new payroll tax replaces existing private health insurance premiums for most workers and employers. Contribution rates are set by an independent, arm's-length board within actuarial corridors, with the mandate that the average worker and employer do not pay more overall than they do currently for health coverage.

Employers are prohibited by law from clawing back the levy through wage cuts or benefit reductions.

UHL revenues flow to the General Revenue Fund but by law may only be used for health spending. Annual public reporting is required on the breakdown of health funding sources.

| Year | Estimated UHL Revenue ($M) |
|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~$610 (partial implementation) |
| Year 2 | ~$1,450 |
| Year 3+ | ~$2,100 (full implementation) |
| Year 10 | ~$2,700 |
| Year 20 | ~$3,500 |

20-year cumulative: ~$52 billion.

The UHL is the single largest new dedicated revenue source. It replaces private insurance premiums that Saskatchewan workers and employers are already paying. The net new burden on the economy is minimal; the money is simply redirected from private insurers to the provincial health system.

### C. Resource Royalties — Complete Redesign

The current royalty regime is opaque, riddled with holidays and deductions, and fails to capture fair value for Saskatchewan residents. The NCP will implement a simple, transparent, two-tier royalty system.

**Base Rate:** A significantly higher floor royalty applicable to all resource extraction (potash, uranium, lithium, rare earths, oil and gas during the sunset period, and all other minerals). Target: the effective rate should capture at least 35% of economic profit.

**Windfall Rate:** A variable surcharge triggered when commodity prices exceed defined thresholds, ensuring Saskatchewan residents share in super-profits. Target: effective capture of up to 49% of profit during boom periods.

**Royalty Revenue Allocation:**
- General Revenue Fund: An annual amount equal to the five-year rolling average of royalty revenue. This provides budget stability.
- Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund: All royalty revenue above the five-year rolling average. This captures windfall gains for future generations.

**15% Floor Contribution to SSF:** Regardless of the rolling average, a minimum of 15% of all base-rate royalty revenues flows directly to the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund each year.

**Close Existing Loopholes:** All existing royalty holidays, accelerated deductions, and potash production tax credits will be phased out over three years. No new subsidies will be granted to extractive industries.

| Year | Estimated Total Resource Revenue ($M) | Vs. Current (~$2,500M) |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~$3,300 | +$800 |
| Year 3 | ~$4,200 | +$1,700 |
| Year 5 | ~$5,100 | +$2,600 |
| Year 10 | ~$6,800 | +$4,300 |
| Year 15 | ~$7,800 | +$5,300 |
| Year 20 | ~$9,000 | +$6,500 |

Resource revenue growth is driven by: higher effective royalty rates, new uranium mines and processing under the SNRC trilateral model (Policy 15), new lithium and rare earth extraction, potash expansion, and closure of existing loopholes. This is partially offset by the 15-year sunset of oil and gas operations (Policy 13), with non-fossil resource revenues more than compensating over time.

20-year cumulative resource revenue: ~$120 billion (vs. ~$50B under current regime).

### D. Energy Veterans Security Surcharge

See Policy 10 — Energy Veterans.

A 5.5% surcharge on all annual Saskatchewan revenues of businesses operating in specified Oil and Gas NAICS code industries. This funds the Energy Veterans pathways through the SSF.

| Year | Estimated Revenue ($M) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~$900 | Full O&G operations |
| Year 5 | ~$750 | Slight decline with sunset beginning |
| Year 10 | ~$450 | Accelerating sunset |
| Year 15 | ~$100 | Near-complete sunset |
| Year 20 | $0 | Sunset complete |

15-year cumulative: ~$8 billion. 80% flows to the SSF; 20% to the GRF for direct Energy Veterans Agency operations.

### E. Crown Corporation Dividends

Every Crown Corporation shall pay the five-year rolling average of its dividend to the GRF. Dividend amounts above the five-year rolling average go to the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund.

As new and expanded Crowns mature (SaskGrocery, STC, SNRC, SMC, SDS, SFG), dividend revenue grows substantially:

| Year | Current Crowns ($M) | New Crowns ($M) | Total ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~$1,545 | $0 | ~$1,545 |
| Year 5 | ~$1,740 | ~$300 | ~$2,040 |
| Year 10 | ~$2,015 | ~$1,100 | ~$3,115 |
| Year 15 | ~$2,340 | ~$2,000 | ~$4,340 |
| Year 20 | ~$2,715 | ~$3,000 | ~$5,715 |

By Year 20, the expanded Crown Corporation system is contributing nearly $6 billion annually. This is the long-term payoff of building productive public assets.

### F. Other New Revenue Sources

| Revenue Source | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vacancy Tax + Dormant Land Tax | 30 | 95 | 120 | 160 |
| Dormant Mineral Lease Tax | 25 | 100 | 120 | 150 |
| Value-Add Levy (raw export) | 0 | 130 | 190 | 250 |
| Film/TV Production Tax Credit (cost) | (15) | (30) | (35) | (45) |
| **Net Other Revenue** | **40** | **295** | **395** | **515** |

### G. Federal Transfers

Federal transfers currently sit at approximately $3 billion annually and grow with population and inflation. The NCP will pursue expanded Canada Health Transfers to reflect Saskatchewan's expanded health coverage, and will negotiate in good faith for additional infrastructure and reconciliation funding.

Conservative assumption: 3.5% annual growth in base transfers, with a 5% uplift beginning Year 4 from successful health transfer negotiations.

| Year | Estimated Federal Transfers ($M) |
|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~$3,105 |
| Year 5 | ~$3,670 |
| Year 10 | ~$4,475 |
| Year 20 | ~$6,650 |

### H. Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund — Interest Disbursements

See Policy 17 — Financial Sovereignty.

As the SSF grows from its $500M seed and ongoing resource royalty contributions, its annual interest disbursements become a material revenue source for the GRF. Target real return: 4-5% annually.

| Year | SSF Principal ($M) | Annual Interest ($M) | SDD Share (54%) | Reconciliation (15%) | Resilience/EV (15%) | Debt (10%) | Strategic (5%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | ~$1,600 | ~$72 | $39 | $11 | $11 | $7 | $4 |
| Year 5 | ~$8,400 | ~$378 | $204 | $57 | $57 | $38 | $19 |
| Year 10 | ~$22,300 | ~$1,004 | $542 | $151 | $151 | $100 | $50 |
| Year 15 | ~$33,400 | ~$1,503 | $812 | $225 | $225 | $150 | $75 |
| Year 20 | ~$47,700 | ~$2,017 | $1,089 | $303 | $303 | $202 | $101 |

By Year 20, the SSF alone generates over $2 billion annually in interest disbursements, with over $1 billion directed to the Dignity Dividend. This is the intergenerational endowment at work.

### Revenue Summary — 20-Year Projection

| Revenue Category | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Personal Income Tax (incl. new rates) | 4,100 | 5,400 | 7,100 | 10,600 |
| Corporate Income Tax (incl. new rates) | 1,280 | 1,600 | 2,000 | 2,900 |
| PST (at 7%) | 3,500 | 4,100 | 4,750 | 6,400 |
| Other Tax Revenue | 3,400 | 3,950 | 4,450 | 5,800 |
| Resource Royalties | 3,300 | 5,100 | 6,800 | 9,000 |
| Federal Transfers | 3,100 | 3,670 | 4,475 | 6,650 |
| Crown Corp Dividends | 1,545 | 2,040 | 3,115 | 5,715 |
| Universal Health Levy | 610 | 2,250 | 2,700 | 3,500 |
| EV Surcharge | 900 | 750 | 450 | 0 |
| SDD Tax Clawback | 600 | 1,320 | 1,520 | 1,960 |
| Vacancy/Dormant/Value-Add | 55 | 325 | 430 | 560 |
| SSF Interest Disbursements | 72 | 378 | 1,004 | 2,017 |
| Other Revenue | 2,000 | 2,320 | 2,690 | 3,610 |
| **Total Revenue** | **~$24,462** | **~$33,203** | **~$41,484** | **~$58,712** |

## Part III — Expenditure Framework

### Operating Budget — Policy-by-Policy Costing

The following tables present the estimated **incremental** cost of each policy above existing baseline spending. Baseline spending (current programs continued at current service levels, growing with inflation and population at ~3.5% annually) is shown separately.

#### Policy 1 — Human Dignity Act

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SHRC Expansion & Act Drafting | 5 | 12 | 15 | 20 |
| **Total** | **5** | **12** | **15** | **20** |

Minimal ongoing cost. The Human Dignity Act is a legislative framework, not a spending program. Costs are limited to expanding the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission's capacity and funding legal expertise for Act drafting.

#### Policy 2 — Saskatchewan Dignity Dividend (SDD)

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gross SDD Payments | 2,660 | 5,580 | 6,500 | 8,800 |
| Less: Tax Clawback (see revenue) | (600) | (1,320) | (1,520) | (1,960) |
| Less: SSF Interest (SDD share) | (39) | (204) | (542) | (1,089) |
| **Net Fiscal Cost** | **~2,020** | **~4,056** | **~4,438** | **~5,751** |

Year 1 is partial (July 1 start). Gross cost grows with population (~1.5% annually) and CPI indexation (2.5%). The net cost narrows over time as the SSF matures and its SDD-earmarked interest grows, and as the tax clawback recovers more from rising incomes.

At $350/month (2027 dollars), this is $4,200 per resident per year. For a family of four, that is $16,800 per year — a transformative income floor.

**Fiscal Multiplier Effect:** The SDD has a fiscal multiplier estimated at 0.8-1.2. Low-income recipients spend nearly 100% of the transfer locally, generating sales tax revenue, local business revenue, and economic activity. The velocity of money effect is strong: $1 of SDD spending circulates multiple times through the Saskatchewan economy before leaving the province.

#### Policy 3 — Universal Health

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pharmacare | 200 | 660 | 770 | 990 |
| Oral Health / Dental | 150 | 550 | 640 | 820 |
| Vision Care | 50 | 165 | 190 | 245 |
| Mental Health & Addictions | 100 | 385 | 450 | 575 |
| Hearing Care | 20 | 83 | 95 | 125 |
| Home & Community Care | 100 | 440 | 510 | 655 |
| 25% Wage Increase (all health workers) | 400 | 1,100 | 1,280 | 1,640 |
| Recruitment Bonuses ($15K, one-time) | 500 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Medical Student Tuition & Living | 50 | 165 | 190 | 245 |
| **Total Health Incremental** | **~1,570** | **~3,548** | **~4,125** | **~5,295** |
| **Less: UHL Revenue** | **(610)** | **(2,250)** | **(2,700)** | **(3,500)** |
| **Net GRF Health Cost** | **~960** | **~1,298** | **~1,425** | **~1,795** |

The UHL covers approximately 60-65% of incremental health costs. The remaining 35-40% comes from the General Revenue Fund, federal health transfers, and efficiency gains from eliminating private insurance administrative overhead (estimated at 15-20% of private premiums vs. 2-3% for single-payer administration).

**Economic Returns:** Universal pharmacare alone is estimated to save the economy $200-400M annually through bulk purchasing power and reduced employer insurance costs. Mental health investment reduces downstream criminal justice and emergency health costs. Dental coverage prevents expensive acute care.

#### Policy 4 — Reconciliation

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reconciliation Commissioner Office | 15 | 20 | 25 | 35 |
| MMIWG2S Office | 15 | 20 | 25 | 35 |
| Consent Protocol Capacity Funding | 20 | 50 | 60 | 80 |
| TLE and Cultural Revitalization | 0 | 80 | 100 | 130 |
| SSF Reconciliation Ring-Fence (15%) | (from SSF) | 57 | 151 | 303 |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~50** | **~170** | **~210** | **~280** |

Plus SSF reconciliation disbursements growing from $11M (Year 1) to $303M (Year 20). Total reconciliation investment over 20 years: ~$6+ billion.

#### Policy 5 — Housing Crisis

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rapid Rebuild Program | 300 | 345 | 255 | 0 |
| SHC Operations & Maintenance | 105 | 160 | 260 | 450 |
| SGI Renters/Housing Insurance | 20 | 23 | 27 | 35 |
| Retrofit Loan Interest Subsidy | 0 | 50 | 80 | 60 |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~425** | **~578** | **~622** | **~545** |

The large-scale 100,000-unit SaskHomes build is **bond-funded** (see Capital Budget below) and does not appear in the operating budget. Rental revenues from public housing service the bonds. The GRF costs here are for immediate repair, SHC operations, and programs that cannot be bond-funded.

#### Policy 6 — 21st Century Connected Communities

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| STC Operations (net of revenue) | 90 | 230 | 250 | 280 |
| Municipal Grants (transit, walkability) | 200 | 460 | 510 | 655 |
| HSR Planning & Corridor Protection | 20 | 57 | 64 | 82 |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~310** | **~747** | **~824** | **~1,017** |

Geothermal ambient loop capital, SaskTel fibre deployment, and STC depot construction are **bond-funded**. Operating costs for SaskEnergy thermal and SaskTel fibre are offset by customer tariffs and service revenues.

#### Policy 7 — Public Safety

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Community Crisis Officers | 80 | 220 | 255 | 330 |
| 24/7 Addictions Centres | 100 | 330 | 385 | 490 |
| Less: Marshal Budget Redirected | (20) | (23) | (27) | (35) |
| **Total** | **~160** | **~527** | **~613** | **~785** |

Addictions Centres funded primarily through the UHL (health spending). Net GRF cost for CCOs is partially offset by reduced police overtime, emergency room visits, and criminal justice costs. Studies of similar programs (CAHOOTS in Eugene, Oregon; STAR in Denver) show 30-50% reductions in police dispatch for targeted call types.

#### Policy 8 — Co-operative Development

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCDA Operations | 15 | 30 | 35 | 45 |
| Less: Brokerage Fee Revenue | 0 | (5) | (10) | (15) |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~15** | **~25** | **~25** | **~30** |

Low-cost, high-return. Every worker co-op created broadens the tax base and keeps profit local.

#### Policy 9 — Fair Labour

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fair Work Authority | 50 | 92 | 105 | 135 |
| SaskJobs Expansion | 40 | 86 | 95 | 125 |
| SME Transition Grants (4 yrs) | 350 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Provincial Sick Day Share (7.5 days) | 0 | 340 | 385 | 490 |
| Apprenticeship Tax Credits | 0 | 50 | 60 | 80 |
| **Total** | **~440** | **~568** | **~645** | **~830** |

The 30-hour work week does not have a direct government cost but has substantial economic implications modelled in Part V. The SME transition grants are temporary (4 years) and deliberately front-loaded.

**Provincial Sick Day Share:** The province covers the first 7.5 sick days per employee per year via payroll tax credits. This costs ~$300-500M annually but reduces workplace illness transmission, improves productivity, and prevents the economic losses from presenteeism (estimated at 2-3× the cost of absenteeism).

#### Policy 10 — Energy Veterans

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $15K Bonuses | 38 | 30 | 30 | 0 |
| Debt Shield (interest reimbursement) | 20 | 16 | 16 | 0 |
| Pension Bridge Payments | 63 | 50 | 50 | 0 |
| Retraining (tuition + wage replacement) | 60 | 48 | 48 | 0 |
| Wage Top-Ups (Redeploy) | 11 | 9 | 9 | 0 |
| EVA Operations | 30 | 34 | 39 | 0 |
| **Total** | **~222** | **~187** | **~192** | **$0** |

Funded through the EV Surcharge → SSF → GRF ring-fenced disbursement. The program sunsets after 15 years. Approximately 30,000-40,000 workers over the life of the program. Cost per worker averages ~$100,000-150,000 across all pathways combined — a fraction of the lifetime earnings and tax contributions of a successfully transitioned worker.

#### Policy 11 — Saskatchewan Century Corps

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wages (~5,000 → 20,000 workers, $30+/hr) | 234 | 562 | 655 | 840 |
| Overhead (benefits, training, equipment) | 105 | 253 | 295 | 378 |
| Tuition Voucher Redemptions | 11 | 31 | 38 | 50 |
| Less: Contract Revenue Returned | (23) | (169) | (295) | (378) |
| **Net GRF Cost** | **~327** | **~677** | **~693** | **~890** |

The SCC is both a spending program and a revenue generator. Its contract work (ambient loop installation, SaskHomes construction, grid modernization, fibre deployment) would otherwise be contracted to private firms at higher cost. The SCC trains the workforce while doing the work, and its contract revenue offsets a growing share of its costs.

**Economic Return:** Every SCC worker trained to journey-level credentials in clean energy, construction, or care work becomes a lifelong taxpayer with $1-2M+ in lifetime earnings. At 15,000-20,000 workers, the SCC generates ~$1B/year in direct wages circulating in the Saskatchewan economy.

#### Policy 12 — Lifelong Learning

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| K-12 Per-Student to $25K (incremental) | 500 | 1,200 | 1,500 | 2,200 |
| 25% Educator Wage Increase | 250 | 575 | 660 | 850 |
| Educator Bonuses ($15K, one-time) | 500 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Education is the second-largest spending category after the SDD. The investment is justified by overwhelming economic evidence: every $1 invested in early childhood education returns $4-9 in reduced social costs and increased lifetime productivity. K-12 investment at $25,000/student would make Saskatchewan the best-funded education system in Canada, attracting families and educators to the province.

#### Policy 13 — Climate Crossroads

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEEA (Environmental Economics) | 30 | 57 | 64 | 82 |
| Climate Lawsuit Legal Costs | 30 | 92 | 105 | 135 |
| SNRC Transition Operations | 100 | 115 | 64 | 0 |
| **Total** | **~160** | **~264** | **~233** | **~217** |

The Climate Lawsuit is a speculative but potentially transformative revenue source. If successful, proceeds flow to the SSF. Even partial success could add tens of billions to the SSF principal. This projection does **not** include lawsuit proceeds in the revenue baseline — they are treated as upside contingency.

#### Policy 14 — Food Sovereignty

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SAB Operations | 50 | 172 | 190 | 245 |
| Margin Insurance (60% province share) | 0 | 115 | 130 | 165 |
| SaskGrocery Operating Subsidy | 100 | 345 | 255 | 165 |
| **Total** | **~150** | **~632** | **~575** | **~575** |

SaskGrocery approaches system-wide break-even by Year 8-10 but retains a geographic parity subsidy to ensure identical Essential Basket pricing province-wide. Capital costs for processing facilities, hopper cars, and terminals are bond-funded.

#### Policy 15 — Resource and Energy Sovereignty

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SNRC Operations | 100 | 230 | 255 | 330 |
| Less: SNRC Profit Offset | 0 | (115) | (640) | (1,320) |
| SaskPower Incremental Ops | 200 | 230 | 640 | 820 |
| EV Charging Infrastructure | 30 | 34 | 39 | 50 |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~330** | **~379** | **~294** | **~(120)** |

By Year 15-20, the SNRC is generating sufficient profit from uranium, lithium, and rare earth operations that it becomes a net contributor to the GRF rather than a cost centre. SaskPower's nuclear and renewable generation creates export revenue (MISO, neighbouring provinces) that offsets incremental operating costs.

#### Policy 16 — Digital Sovereignty

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SDS Operations | 50 | 172 | 190 | 245 |
| SaskStack Development | 30 | 57 | 64 | 82 |
| Less: Vendor Savings | 0 | (34) | (128) | (165) |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~80** | **~195** | **~126** | **~162** |

Digital sovereignty is a cost-reduction strategy in the medium term. Eliminating vendor lock-in, licence fees, and American cloud hosting costs saves hundreds of millions over the 20-year period. SaskCloud and SaskTel data centre operations are funded by SaskBonds capital and user fees.

#### Policy 17 — Financial Sovereignty

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SSF Seed Capital | 500 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| SFG Operations | 20 | 23 | 27 | 35 |
| **Total GRF Cost** | **~520** | **~23** | **~27** | **~35** |

The $500M SSF seed is a one-time investment that generates compounding returns for generations. The SFG operates from its own capital (provincial float) and investment returns.

#### Policy 18 — Democratic Renewal

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elections SK (50% increase) | 10 | 12 | 13 | 17 |

| Expanded Legislature (100 seats) | 15 | 17 | 19 | 25 |
| Per-Vote Subsidy ($2.50/vote) | 4 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| **Total** | **~34** | **~44** | **~50** | **~65** |

Democracy is cheap. The entire democratic renewal costs less per year than a single kilometre of highway.

#### Policy 19 — Manufacturing

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SMC Operations | 100 | 345 | 385 | 490 |
| Less: Factory Revenue Offset | 0 | (57) | (385) | (825) |
| **Net GRF Cost** | **~100** | **~288** | **~0** | **~(335)** |

Like the SNRC, the SMC transitions from a cost centre to a profit centre as factories reach full production. By Year 10-12, the combination of SaskHomes modules, heat pump assemblies, food processing, and uranium fuel fabrication generates enough revenue to cover operating costs. By Year 15-20, SMC is a net contributor to the GRF.

#### Policy 20 — Disaster Resilience

| Component | Year 1 ($M) | Year 5 ($M) | Year 10 ($M) | Year 20 ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resilience Hub Upgrades | 50 | 57 | 39 | 30 |

| SPSA Operations & Drills | 20 | 23 | 27 | 35 |
| **Total** | **~120** | **~137** | **~92** | **~65** |

Front-loaded investment that declines as hardening is completed. Every $1 spent on disaster preparedness saves $4-11 in avoided disaster response and recovery costs (FEMA estimates).

#### Policy 21 — Funding Administration

## Part IV — The Capital Budget: SaskBonds

The capital budget is entirely separate from the operating budget. Capital investments are funded by SaskBonds — government-obligation or use-of-proceeds bonds sold to Saskatchewan residents, pension funds, institutional investors, and ESG-aligned funds. These bonds fund productive assets that generate revenue to service their own debt.

### SaskBonds Structure

All SaskBonds are Government Obligation (GO) bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Saskatchewan. They are issued in use-of-proceeds series, meaning every dollar raised is ring-fenced for a specific project category. No general revenue slush.

**Minimums:** $100 per bond, so every Saskatchewan resident can invest.

**Access:** Automatic payroll deductions, online portal, and SFG/credit union purchase points.

**Tranches:** Each bond series has a Senior and Junior class:
- **Junior Tranche (First Loss):** Purchased by the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund. Absorbs any revenue shortfalls before they affect senior bondholders.
- **Senior Tranche:** Sold to residents, pension funds, and institutional investors. Backed by the SSF junior tranche AND the full faith and credit of the Government of Saskatchewan.

This structure is designed to achieve a AA or better credit rating on the senior tranche.

**Reporting:** Annual allocation reports, second-party opinions, and full public transparency on every dollar spent.

### Bond Series

| Series | Purpose | Maturities | Target ($B, 20yr) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Foundation Bonds** (Limited) | New Crown Corp startups (one-time) | 25 yr | $6.0 |
| **SaskHousing Bonds** | 100,000 public housing units, backed by rental revenue (a public REIT) | 10-30 yr | $25.0 |
| **SaskEnergy Bonds** | Ambient loops, grid modernization, renewables, nuclear | 15-30 yr | $18.0 |
| **SaskInfrastructure Bonds** | Municipal upgrades, STC depots, data centres, HSR corridor | 10-25 yr | $12.0 |
| **SaskManufacturing Bonds** | SMC factories, processing facilities | 10-25 yr | $7.0 |
| **SaskInvestment Bonds** | General savings bond for residents, monthly coupon | 5-10 yr | $9.0 |
| **Total 20-Year Bond Issuance** | | | **~$77.0** |

### SaskHousing Bonds — The Public Housing REIT

The SaskHousing Bonds deserve special attention. They are structured as a revenue bond backed by the rental cash flows of the 100,000 public housing units.

The sequence:

1. **Foundation Bonds** (Year 1-3): $2-3B in GO bonds backed purely by GRF. Used to build the first 10,000-15,000 units.
2. **Prove the Asset** (Year 2-4): Once those units are built, tenanted, and generating stable rental cash flow for 24 months, you have a proven, class-A asset.
3. **Securitize** (Year 3+): That proven revenue stream is securitized into the larger SaskHousing Bond series. With a proven asset, the SSF as first-loss protection, and a government backstop, the senior tranche can achieve a AA rating.
4. **Repeat:** Each tranche of bonds funds the next batch of units. Each batch's rental revenue is added to the collateral pool. The bond becomes safer with each iteration.

Rent is always paid in Saskatchewan, especially with the Dignity Dividend ensuring no tenant falls below the income floor needed to pay 30%-of-income rent. Default risk is extremely low.

**SaskHousing Bonds are a public REIT** — a real estate investment trust owned by the people, paying coupons from rental revenue, building homes at cost with no developer profit margin.

### Capital Budget — 20-Year Projection

| Category | Year 1-5 ($B) | Year 6-10 ($B) | Year 11-15 ($B) | Year 16-20 ($B) | Total ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation Bonds | 6.0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6.0 |
| Housing Bonds | 7.0 | 10.0 | 5.5 | 2.5 | 25.0 |
| Energy Bonds | 4.5 | 7.5 | 4.0 | 2.0 | 18.0 |
| Infrastructure Bonds | 5.0 | 4.0 | 2.0 | 1.0 | 12.0 |
| Manufacturing Bonds | 3.0 | 3.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 7.0 |
| Investment Bonds | 2.0 | 3.0 | 2.0 | 2.0 | 9.0 |
| **Total** | **27.5** | **27.5** | **14.0** | **8.0** | **77.0** |

### Debt Sustainability

| Metric | Year 5 | Year 10 | Year 15 | Year 20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cumulative Bond Debt ($B) | ~$27.5 | ~$55.0 | ~$69.0 | ~$77.0 |
| Gross Debt Service ($B/yr) | ~$1.1 | ~$2.2 | ~$2.8 | ~$3.1 |
| Asset Revenue Offset ($B/yr) | ~$0.5 | ~$1.4 | ~$2.2 | ~$2.7 |
| **Net Debt Service ($B/yr)** | **~$0.6** | **~$0.8** | **~$0.6** | **~$0.4** |
| Debt-to-GDP Ratio | ~18% | ~26% | ~27% | ~24% |
| Net Debt Service as % of Revenue | ~1.8% | ~2.0% | ~1.2% | ~0.7% |

The debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at approximately 27% around Year 12-15, then declines as assets mature and generate growing revenue streams. For context, the Canadian federal government's debt-to-GDP ratio is approximately 42%, and most AA-rated provinces carry 25-35%. Saskatchewan's current net debt-to-GDP ratio is approximately 12%.

The critical insight is that this is **productive debt** — it builds homes that generate rent, factories that generate revenue, nuclear reactors that generate electricity, and infrastructure that supports economic growth. It is not consumption debt.

## Part V — Economic Impact: The 20-Year Transformation

### GDP Growth

The S21P platform transforms Saskatchewan's economy through five channels:

1. **Infrastructure Multiplier (1.5-2.0):** Every $1 of infrastructure spending generates $1.50-$2.00 in GDP through direct construction activity, supply chain demand, and induced consumption. At $3-5B/year in bond-funded capital spending, this adds $5-10B/year to GDP.

2. **Transfer Payment Multiplier (0.8-1.2):** The SDD puts money directly into the hands of consumers with high marginal propensity to consume. $5B+ in annual SDD payments generates $4-6B in consumer spending, overwhelmingly within Saskatchewan.

3. **Public Service Multiplier (1.2-1.6):** Health and education spending creates well-paying local jobs. The 25% wage increases for health and education workers immediately boost consumer spending power.

4. **Velocity of Money Premium (1-2% GDP):** The SFG, credit unions, Crown Corporations, and SaskBonds keep money circulating within the province. Each dollar earned and spent locally generates more economic activity than dollars extracted to distant corporate headquarters or shareholders. Over five years, this builds to a 1-2% permanent GDP premium.

5. **Population Growth (1.5-2.0%/year):** Universal health care, the Dignity Dividend, affordable housing, 30-hour work weeks, and world-class education make Saskatchewan the most attractive province in Canada. Population growth drives tax base growth.

### 20-Year GDP Projection

| Year | Baseline GDP ($B) | Enhanced GDP ($B) | Policy GDP Boost ($B) | Real Growth Rate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 (2027) | $100 | $123 | $23 | ~7% |
| Year 3 (2029) | $109 | $137 | $28 | ~5% |
| Year 5 (2031) | $119 | $152 | $33 | ~4.5% |
| Year 10 (2036) | $145 | $186 | $41 | ~3.5% |
| Year 15 (2041) | $176 | $227 | $51 | ~3% |
| Year 20 (2046) | $214 | $274 | $60 | ~3% |

By Year 20, Saskatchewan's GDP is approximately 28% larger than it would be under a business-as-usual scenario. GDP per capita grows from ~$78,000 (2025) to ~$164,000 (2046), reflecting both real economic growth and inflation.

### Employment

| Year | Base Employment | New Direct Jobs | Total Employment Effect (incl. indirect) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 580,000 | ~95,000 | ~145,000 |
| Year 5 | 615,000 | ~130,000 | ~194,000 |
| Year 10 | 655,000 | ~120,000 | ~180,000 |
| Year 20 | 740,000 | ~80,000 | ~117,000 |

The employment surge is front-loaded during the construction boom (Years 1-10). The Century Corps alone employs 15,000-20,000 directly. Bond-funded construction employs tens of thousands more. As the economy stabilizes at higher capacity, the employment effect becomes more about quality (higher wages, better conditions) than quantity.

### The 30-Hour Work Week — Economic Modelling

The transition to a 30-hour standard work week is the most economically significant reform in Policy 9. It has no direct government cost but reshapes the economy.

**Assumption:** Employers hire additional staff to maintain output. With wages held constant (same weekly/monthly pay for 30 hours as formerly for 40), labor costs per hour rise by ~33%.

**Offsets:**
- Productivity per hour increases. Evidence from 4-day work week trials shows 20-40% productivity improvement per hour. Conservative assumption: 15% improvement.
- Reduced absenteeism, turnover, and workplace injury. Saves employers 5-10% of labor costs.
- Reduced unemployment and underemployment. New workers enter the labor market, expanding the tax base.
- Higher consumer spending from newly employed workers (multiplier effect).
- Reduced healthcare and social service costs from a healthier, less stressed population.

**Net Impact:** The 30-hour week is a short-term cost to employers (~15-20% net increase in labor costs after productivity gains), partially offset by SME transition grants (4 years), offset in the medium term by a larger employed tax base, and offset in the long term by a more productive, healthier, more innovative workforce. Evidence from France's 35-hour week showed initial costs followed by sustained employment growth and GDP convergence within 5-7 years.

## Part VI — Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund: The Intergenerational Endowment

### Growth Trajectory

| Year | Annual Contributions ($M) | Cumulative Principal ($M) | Annual Interest ($M) | Total Disbursements ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1,633 | 1,633 | 72 | 72 |
| 3 | 1,950 | 4,647 | 209 | 209 |
| 5 | 2,100 | 8,374 | 378 | 378 |
| 10 | 2,700 | 19,623 | 883 | 883 |
| 15 | 2,800 | 33,425 | 1,504 | 1,504 |
| 20 | 3,200 | 47,745 | 2,017 | 2,017 |

**Contributions:** The SSF is funded by: the $500M seed, 15% of base resource royalties, 50% of windfall royalties, 80% of the EV Surcharge, Crown dividends above the 5-year rolling average, and the junior tranche purchases of SaskBonds.

**Comparison:** At $47.7 billion by Year 20, the SSF would be comparable to the Alaska Permanent Fund ($80B) in relative terms for Saskatchewan's population, and approximately 17% of the size of Alberta's Heritage Fund ($23B actual, which would be $300B+ had Alberta saved properly).

**Climate Lawsuit Upside:** If the Climate Lawsuit (Policy 13) produces even partial success — say, $10-50 billion in settlements or judgments over 10-20 years — the SSF could reach $75-100 billion by Year 20, permanently funding the Dignity Dividend and Reconciliation initiatives from interest alone.

### Disbursement Formula (Locked by Supermajority)

| Category | Share | Year 20 Amount ($M) |
|---|---|---|
| Saskatchewan Dignity Dividend | 54% | $1,089 |
| Reconciliation Funding | 15% | $303 |
| Resilience & Energy Veterans | 15% | $303 |
| Debt Servicing | 10% | $202 |
| Strategic Domestic Investment | 5% | $101 |
| Administration | 1% | ~$20 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **~$2,017** |

## Part VII — Fiscal Balance and Sustainability

### The Honest Assessment

This platform is expensive. There is no pretending otherwise. In the first 5-8 years, the operating budget will run deficits as new spending programs are implemented faster than new revenue streams mature. This is deliberate: the spending creates the conditions for the revenue.

### Annual Fiscal Balance (Operating + Net Debt Service)

| Year | Total Revenue ($M) | Total Spending ($M) | Annual Balance ($M) | Cumulative Balance ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (2027) | 24,462 | 29,045 | (4,583) | (4,583) |
| 3 (2029) | 29,400 | 35,300 | (5,900) | (14,500) |
| 5 (2031) | 33,200 | 38,100 | (4,900) | (24,500) |
| 7 (2033) | 36,500 | 41,500 | (5,000) | (33,000) |
| 10 (2036) | 41,500 | 43,400 | (1,900) | (43,000) |
| 12 (2038) | 44,500 | 46,500 | (2,000) | (47,000) |
| 15 (2041) | 50,000 | 52,000 | (2,000) | (52,000) |
| 18 (2044) | 55,500 | 57,000 | (1,500) | (56,000) |
| 20 (2046) | 58,700 | 57,800 | +900 | (53,500) |

The operating deficit peaks in Years 3-5 as the SDD, health, and education expansions reach full implementation. It narrows steadily as Crown Corporation revenues grow, the SSF matures, resource revenues expand from new mines, and the enlarged economy generates more tax revenue. By Year 18-20, the platform achieves approximate fiscal balance.

### How the Gap Is Managed

The cumulative operating deficit over 20 years of approximately $53 billion is managed through:

1. **Provincial borrowing at AA-rated GO bond rates** (~3.5-4.0%). The deficit is financed alongside the capital program. Saskatchewan's combined debt-to-GDP ratio remains below 30% throughout.

2. **Economic growth feedback.** Every 1% of additional GDP growth generates approximately $500M in additional tax revenue. The model projects GDP 28% higher than baseline by Year 20 — translating into $5-8B/year in additional revenue that is already captured in the projections above but conservatively estimated.

3. **Crown Corporation maturation.** New Crowns (SMC, SNRC, SaskGrocery, STC, SDS) transition from cost centres to profit centres between Years 8-15, contributing an eventual $3B+ annually in dividends.

4. **SSF compounding.** By Year 20, SSF interest alone covers $1.1B of the SDD and $300M of reconciliation. By Year 30 (not modelled), the SSF would generate $3-4B annually.

5. **Climate Lawsuit contingency.** Not included in projections. Even $10B in settlement proceeds would reduce the cumulative gap by approximately 20%.

### Debt Sustainability Summary

| Metric | Year 5 | Year 10 | Year 15 | Year 20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total Provincial Debt (bonds + operating) ($B) | ~$52 | ~$98 | ~$121 | ~$131 |
| Debt-to-GDP Ratio | ~34% | ~53% | ~53% | ~48% |
| Interest Costs as % of Revenue | ~6% | ~8% | ~7% | ~6% |
| Net Debt-to-Revenue Ratio | 1.6x | 2.4x | 2.4x | 2.2x |

These ratios are higher than Saskatchewan's current position (~15% debt-to-GDP) but within the range of comparable Canadian provinces (Ontario: ~40%, Quebec: ~43%, federal: ~42%). The critical distinction is that Saskatchewan's debt is overwhelmingly invested in productive assets (housing, factories, reactors, infrastructure) that generate revenue, unlike consumption-driven debt.

## Part VIII — Risk Assessment

### Fiscal Risks (High Impact)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resource price collapse | Medium | High | SSF stabilization reserve; diversified resource base (potash, uranium, lithium vs. O&G dependence) |
| Interest rate spike | Medium | High | Fixed-rate bonds; phased issuance; SSF first-loss layer |
| Population growth below projections | Low-Medium | High | SDD, universal health, and housing are powerful migration attractors |
| Federal government non-cooperation | Medium | Medium | Platform designed to function under provincial jurisdiction; federal transfers are supplementary |
| Legal challenges to Redwater Strategy | High | High | Constitutional division of powers strongly supports provincial environmental regulation; contingency plans for SNRC operations |
| 30-hour week reduces output | Low-Medium | Medium | Evidence from global trials suggests productivity per hour increases; SME transition grants ease adjustment |

### Economic Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capital flight | Medium | Medium | SFG keeps provincial float local; Credit Union ecosystem strengthened; SaskBonds provide local investment outlet |
| Inflation from stimulus | Medium | Medium | Phased implementation; UHL and tax increases are contractionary offsets; SaskGrocery Essential Basket provides price anchor |
| Labour shortage during transition | Medium | Medium | SCC and Energy Veterans provide trained workforce; immigration attraction; SaskJobs active placement |
| Bond market appetite insufficient | Low-Medium | High | SSF first-loss tranche de-risks; GO backing; diversified series; $100 minimum retail bonds expand buyer base |

### Upside Scenarios (Not Included in Projections)

1. **Climate Lawsuit Success:** $10-100B in settlements, transforming the SSF.
2. **Nuclear Export Revenue:** Saskatchewan CANDU-powered electricity exported to MISO and Canadian provinces could generate $1-3B/year.
3. **Uranium Fuel Export:** Domestic fuel fabrication for Canadian nuclear fleet generates hundreds of millions.
4. **Medical Isotope Revenue:** Flooding the global isotope market from CANDU byproducts.
5. **Tech Economy Growth:** SaskStack, SaskOS, and open-source government tools attract tech companies and remote workers.
6. **Agricultural Value-Add:** Saskatchewan flour, canola oil, and processed meat replacing imports nationally.

## Part IX — Fiscal Rules and Safeguards

### 1. METR Cap
The combined Marginal Effective Tax Rate across all programs (PIT, SDD phase-out, UHL, benefit clawbacks) must not exceed 55% at any income level. Annual publication required.

### 2. SSF Supermajority Lock
The SSF principal cannot be accessed, and the disbursement formula cannot be changed, without a two-thirds supermajority vote in the Legislature.

### 3. Bond Transparency
Every SaskBond series must publish annual allocation reports showing exactly where every dollar was spent. Second-party opinions required for each series.

### 4. Crown Corporation Performance
Each new Crown Corporation must publish quarterly financial dashboards and face annual independent performance reviews. Any Crown operating at a loss for more than five consecutive years must submit a restructuring plan to the Legislature.

### 5. Sunset Provisions
The SME Transition Grants (4 years), Energy Veterans Surcharge (15 years), and Oil & Gas operational licences (15 years) automatically sunset. No legislative action required to end them.

### 6. Debt Ceiling
Total provincial debt (bonds + operating) must not exceed 60% of GDP. If the ratio exceeds 50%, the Minister of Finance must table a fiscal consolidation plan within 90 days.

### 7. Annual Budget Publication
A full PBO-style fiscal update must be published annually, including updated 20-year projections, METR analysis, Crown Corporation performance, SSF statements, and bond allocation reports. The numbers hide nothing.

## The Funding

This is Policy 21.

Every number above is an estimate. Every assumption is stated. Every risk is acknowledged.

The honest truth is this: the Saskatchewan 21 Policies cost a great deal of money. They also build a great deal of wealth — human, social, and financial — that compounds over decades. The question is not whether we can afford to do this. The question is whether we can afford not to.

Saskatchewan currently exports raw resources, imports finished goods, and watches its young people leave for opportunities elsewhere. The S21P reverses that flow: we process our own resources, build our own goods, train our own people, and create an economy so attractive that people come to us.

The first decade will be hard. The deficits are real. The debt is real. But so are the homes, the hospitals, the factories, the geothermal loops, the nuclear reactors, the schools, the grocery stores, and the 100,000 families with a place to live.

By Year 20, Saskatchewan will have:
- A GDP 28% larger than the status quo.
- A nearly $48 billion Sovereign Wealth Fund generating $2 billion per year.
- 100,000 new public housing units.
- Universal health care with no out-of-pocket costs.
- A 30-hour work week with $25+ minimum wage.
- Clean, abundant nuclear and renewable energy.
- A connected, walkable, transit-linked province.
- Full digital sovereignty.
- A thriving manufacturing sector.
- Meaningful reconciliation backed by real money.
- And every resident receiving a Dignity Dividend, no questions asked.

> We all pay our fair share to share in a fair society.

# FAQ

- How can you afford all of this?
	- The same way every major economy has ever built transformative infrastructure: you invest public money in productive assets that grow the economy, and you capture a fair share of resource wealth. We raise revenue through progressive taxation, payroll levies that replace private insurance premiums, redesigned resource royalties, and bonds backed by the assets they build. Then the larger economy generates the tax revenue to sustain the programs. It's a virtuous cycle, not a magic trick.

- Won't this drive businesses out of Saskatchewan?
	- We are building the best-educated, healthiest, most well-rested workforce in Canada, connected by world-class infrastructure, powered by cheap abundant energy, and backed by a public financial system that keeps capital circulating locally. Businesses don't flee to quality — they flock to it. The 30-hour week and higher minimum wage raise costs for some employers in the short term, but the transition grants, expanded consumer spending, and access to SaskJobs-placed talent more than compensate.

- What if the Climate Lawsuit fails?
	- The entire fiscal model is built without a single dollar of lawsuit proceeds. If the lawsuit produces nothing, nothing changes. If it produces anything, it's all upside flowing directly to the SSF.

- Isn't $77 billion in bonds too much debt?
	- Saskatchewan's total debt-to-GDP ratio stays below Ontario's and Quebec's throughout the entire 20-year period. And unlike consumption debt, this debt builds homes, factories, nuclear reactors, and infrastructure that generate revenue. The bonds pay for themselves through the assets they create.

- What if resource prices crash?
	- The SSF has a Stabilization Reserve equal to two years of expected disbursements. Royalty revenue going to the GRF is smoothed via the five-year rolling average. And the entire point of diversifying from O&G to uranium, lithium, potash, and rare earths is to reduce commodity concentration risk.
