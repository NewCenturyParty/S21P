# Detailed Policy 

### The Problem

The cost of living is out of control and people need help. 

### The Promise

A Universal Basic Income of $350 per month, no questions asked. 

If you are a Saskatchewan Resident, you are eligible. 

### The Plan

The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Universal Basic Income Act.

This Act shall legally mandate that, starting July 1 of the following year, every resident in Saskatchewan will receive $350 each month.

Every year thereafter, the Dignity Dividend will be indexed to Saskatchewan's CPI inflation. That way it's real value is protected.

The Ministry of Social Services shall create a new division dedicated to the operation and release of the Dignity Dividend.

To receive the benefit, all a resident has to do is apply once, providing their health card and direct deposit information. Payments will then continue automatically each month.

Those with children can apply on their child’s behalf using the child’s health card and the parent’s bank account. When the child turns 18, they must apply for themselves with their own bank account.

A T-Slip will be issued to the CRA each year showing the total yearly benefit amount. The Dignity Dividend will count as provincial taxable income, but a new non-refundable Dignity Tax Credit will implemented to protect it for low and middle incomes.

- If you earn under $50,000, the Dignity Tax Credit will fully offset provincial income tax on your Dignity Dividend. You keep the full $350/month after provincial tax.

- Between $50,000 and $100,000, the credit will gradually phase out, so you keep most of the benefit but contribute a bit back through your taxes.

- Above $100,000, the credit will no longer apply. You still receive the Dignity Dividend like everyone else, but it is fully taxable at Saskatchewan’s normal provincial income tax rates.

Clawbacks will only be done for those that move out of the province while still receiving the benefit. The Dignity Dividend cannot be garnished or assigned in anyway outside of Court Ordered Child or Spousal Support.

This will not replace any existing benefit given by the Government of Saskatchewan. The NCP will not remove or reduce in any way, programs like SIS, SAID, SIP, PCHB, SHB, SEI, etc. 

### The Funding

The payments will come out of General Revenues. 

The money will come from a variety of factors, like increased taxes, royalty rates, and Crown dividend payments, including annual interest endowment from the Saskatchewan Sovereignty Fund. 

For more information see both Policy 17 - Financial Sovereignty and Policy 21 - Funding.

### What It Means For You

It means you have a little more room to breathe. 

It means your Dignity is acknowledged, and not something you budget around. 

It means you matter.
