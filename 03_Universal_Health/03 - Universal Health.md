# Detailed Policy

### The Problem

Public Health Care is slowly being privatized and dismantled, even with most extended healthcare services already being private. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep a regular family doctor, or any medical professional at all.

### The Promise

The same promise Saskatchewan made over half a century ago: a single payer plan that is $0 at point of service.

Just bring your Health Card. That's it. 

The NCP also commits to the largest recruitment drive this province has ever seen, to ensure we have the people to provide the care we need. 

### The Plan

The NCP will introduce The Saskatchewan Universal Health Act.

This Act will expand Saskatchewan's Medicare to create a new Single Payer plan that insures all medically necessary services  in the following areas:

- Hospitals and Facility Care
	- In-patient and out-patient hospital services.
	- Surgical, emergency, diagnostic, and rehabilitation services.
	- Services provided in publicly funded clinics and day-surgery centres. 
- Physician and Primary Care Services
	- Medically necessary services provided by family physicians, specialists, nurse practitioners, and other licensed medical providers. 
- Nursing and Allied Health Services
	- Nursing care in hospitals, clinics, community, and home settings.
	- Rehabilitation services (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, etc.)
- Pharmacare 
	- Medically necessary prescription medication dispensed in community and hospital settings
	- Generic and bio-similar first, with clinical exceptions.
- Oral Health 
	- Medically necessary dental care provided by dentists and dental specialists (including endodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, oral surgery).
	- Medically necessary orthodontics (braces, aligners) when require for function, airway, pain, or oral health. 
- Vision Care
	- Medically Necessary eye exams and treatments.
	- Prescription lenses and basic frames.
	- Low-vision devices and medically required ophthalmic procedures (excluding purely cosmetic surgery).
- Mental Health and Addictions Care
	- Assessment and treatment provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, counsellors, and other licensed mental health professionals.
	- Community mental health clinics, harm reduction, and addictions care. 
	- Treatment Resistant expanded care, including cutting edge treatments. 
- Hearing Care
	- Assessment and treatment provided by audiologists and other licensed providers. 
	- Medically necessary hearing aids and implantable devices. 
- Home and Community Care
	- Home nursing, rehab, personal support, palliative care, and paramedic-treat-and-refer services.
	- Community-based supports that allow people to live safely at home (SaskPoles, etc)
- Long-Term Care and Assisted Living 
	- Care in long-term care homes and personal care homes that will be mandated to transition to public or not-for-profit operation. 
	- Medically necessary nursing, personal care, and allied health services in these settings. 

**Medically necessary:**

What is considered medically necessary within each area will be determined by the treating clinician, within peer norms, and guided by independent Benefit Councils made up of clinicians and patient representatives. Government will not have a say in what is medically necessary. 

**No two-tier system:**

The Insurance Act will be amended to ensure that no extra billing is allowed for insured medical services, and private insurance companies will be prohibited from offering duplicate coverage. Private insurance will only be allowed for cosmetic or non-medically necessary extras. No two tiered systems. 

**Patient Safety:**

Doctors, nurses, and other care staff will be guaranteed safe patient ratios, determined by the Benefit Councils, that if breached will automatically close beds that cannot be safely staffed to ensure patient and practitioner health and safety. 

**Recruitment:**

To recruit and retain more healthcare professionals, the NCP will:

- Offer to raise the wages for all public medical professions by 25% minimum. 

- Provide a $15,000 bonus to current, new, and returning staff.

- Provide free, weekly, Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR) evaluations by the Saskatchewan Health Authority for any out of province or international medical staff, with the evaluations happening as quickly as safely allowable.

- Mandate expanded seats for all medical professions in every post-secondary institution in Saskatchewan. 

- Pay any medical students' tuition and living expenses, in Saskatchewan, in Canada, or in the Commonwealth, provided they agree to stay or move in province, wherever they are placed, for 5 years, with additional bonuses for those who stay 10 years or more. 

### The Funding

The Canada Health Act health transfers will continue, and the NCP is committed to working with the federal government to expand service coverage and funding to meet or exceed Saskatchewan standards. 

A new payroll tax shall be implemented, to be known as the Universal Health Levy (UHL). 

- The UHL will replace existing private insurance plan payments for most workers and employers.

- Contribution rates will be set within actuarial corridors by an independent, arm's length board (including actuaries, health experts, labour and employer reps), with the goal that the average worker and employer do not pay more overall than they do today for health coverage. 

- By law, employers will be prohibited from clawing back the levy through wage cuts or benefit reductions. 

Revenues from UHL will go into the General Revenue fund, but by law may only be used for health spending. Each year, the government must report publicly how much of health care is funded by the UHL, federal transfers, and other provincial revenues. 


### What It Means For You


It means your health isn't tied to your wallet.

It means that your dignity is met where you need it most. 

And it means that in Saskatchewan, we look out for each other.

# FAQ

- What if I leave Saskatchewan before finishing the 5 year mandatory placement after medical school?
	- If you leave early the amount you have already been paid, tuition and living costs, will convert into a zero interest loan, like a Saskatchewan Student Loan. If you return to Saskatchewan within the following five years you can pick up where you left off, freezing the loan payments and paying it off after a full five years served. 

- What are Benefit Councils 
	- Benefit Councils are groups of clinicians responsible for each of the insured health care sectors. For example, the Oral Health Benefit Council will be made up of working Dentists, Orthodontists, Dental Hygienists, as well as recent patients. They will meet every quarter to decide and discuss and decide costs and coverages, ensuring they meet the people as they see them.

- How much will this cost me?
	- The mandate will be that the cost be no higher than it would be to have the private insurance it would cost to insure the same programs. You and your boss are already paying for this. The only difference is the money now stays in Saskatchewan and pays the Saskatchewan People, not distant shareholders. 

- What exactly is Medically Necessary?
	- That's between you and your treating clinician. The government takes its hands out of the equation. There are peer norms to follow, which just means whoever is treating you cannot be irresponsible. And those norms are determined by the sector's Benefit Council.

- What services are covered?
	- Everything medically necessary across hospitals, physicians, nursing, pharmacare, dental, vision, mental health and addictions, hearing, home and community care, and long-term care. Just bring your Health Card.

- Will I still be able to get private insurance?
	- Private insurance will only be allowed for cosmetic or non-medically necessary extras. It is prohibited from offering duplicate coverage for anything the public plan already covers. No two-tier system.

- What about dental and vision?
	- Both are fully covered under the plan when medically necessary. That includes dental care, orthodontics when required for function or health, eye exams, prescription lenses and basic frames, and medically required eye procedures.

- How will the province recruit enough doctors and nurses?
	- Through the largest recruitment drive in the province's history: a 25% minimum wage increase for all public medical professions, a $15,000 bonus for current, new, and returning staff, expanded seats at every post-secondary institution, and full tuition and living expenses paid for medical students who commit to staying in province for 5 years.

- What happens to long-term care homes?
	- Long-term care homes and personal care homes will be mandated to transition to public or not-for-profit operation. Care in these settings will be fully covered under the plan.

- What is the Universal Health Levy?
	- A new payroll tax that replaces existing private insurance plan payments. Contribution rates are set by an independent board with the goal that the average worker and employer do not pay more overall than they do today. Employers are prohibited from clawing the levy back through wage cuts or benefit reductions.

- Will mental health care be covered?
	- Yes. Assessment and treatment by psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, counsellors, and other licensed mental health professionals are fully covered, including community clinics, harm reduction, addictions care, and cutting-edge treatment-resistant care.
