# Detailed Policy:


### The Problem

Once in a generation catastrophes now happen near yearly. 

### The Promise

An NCP government will ensure Saskatchewan is ready for any disaster that may come. 

### The Plan

The NCP will introduce the Saskatchewan Disaster Resilience Act.

This Act will empower the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency (SPSA) to build out a fleet of Resilience Hubs across the province, in every community, to ensure that no matter where a person lives they are ready for whatever the 21st Century Brings. 

<strong><u>Resilience Hubs:</u></strong> 

The SPSA will work with municipalities across the province to identify potential Resilience Hubs. These Hubs will be located in buildings already designed for large gatherings and then hardened to be able to withstand any disaster that may come and provide a safe haven for the population. 

The goal will be for 90% of residents being able to reach a Resilience Hub within a 30 minute drive. 

Resilience Hubs will receive tax credits for the service they provide. The initial sites to be scouted for Resilience Hubs will include:

- Elementary Schools, High Schools, and Universities 
- Places of Worship
- Community and Recreation Centres
- Large Supermarkets
- Malls

Resilience Hub's will be hardened and weatherized so that they can withstand any weather event, with a goal of reaching near passive house levels of energy efficiency and extreme weather resistance. 

All Hub's must have islandable power separate from the grids as to withstand prolonged power outages. Thus they will have supplied their own solar panels and commercial-scale batteries. 

To protect residents during wild fire smoke events or respiratory pandemics, all Hubs will have hospital grade levels of air quality, with a goal of 15+ Air Changes per Hour (ACH). To achieve this the Hub's will receive grants to upgrade their air filtration with new MERV 13+ filters, HEPA filters, including portable filters for areas where central air cannot reach or move air effectively. 

Satellite phone and internet, and regular radios, will be installed in all Hubs as well so that communications can persist regardless of disaster. 

The SPSA will run quarterly audits and drills to ensure that all Resilience Hubs are consistent, up to date, and ready for anything. 

All Hubs must have 72 hours worth of supplies that includes:

- Potable Water
- Cots and Beds
- Blankets
- First-Aid kits
- Oxygen tanks
- Charging and power infrastructure
- Refrigerated medication storage
- Radio and other communications equipment 

Additionally, the SPSA will mandate that every Ministry, Crown Corp, Municipality, school, hospital, etc to have an Emergency and Disaster Response Plan. These plans must include extensive preparation and planning for various disaster possibilities, including the following:

- Active Shooter
- Wildfire - Forrest
- Wildfire - Prairie Plains
- Wildfire Smoke 
- Flood - River Expansion
- Flood - Rain / Flash Flood
- Earthquake
- Tornado 
- Severe / Life threatening Thunderstorm
- Extreme Drought
- Extreme Heat and Heat Domes
- Prolonged (24 hr +) Power Outage - All causes 

The SPSA will also be mandated to work with Indigenous Nations across the province to complete prescribed burns of Saskatchewan forests to prevent future out of control wildfires. 

The Disaster Resilience Act will include a requirement of islandable power by 2035 for all critical human infrastructure, including the following places:

- Hospitals
- Schools
- 911 Centres
- Police Precincts
- Jails
- Fire Halls
- All Resilience Hubs
- Power Grids

### The Funding

This policy is funded from the General Revenue Fund, and aligned to the revenue measures in Policy 21 - Funding.

### What It Means For You

It means being proactive, not reactive. 

It means you have peace of mind.

It means the dignity of protecting each other.

# FAQ

- What is a Resilience Hub?
	- A building already designed for large gatherings, like schools, community centres, and places of worship, that has been hardened to withstand any disaster. They have islandable power, hospital-grade air filtration, satellite communications, and 72 hours of emergency supplies.

- How close will the nearest Resilience Hub be?
	- The goal is for 90% of residents to be within a 30-minute drive of a Resilience Hub.

- What kind of disasters are covered?
	- Every Ministry, Crown Corp, municipality, school, and hospital must have plans for active shooters, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, extreme drought, heat domes, and prolonged power outages, among others.

- What is islandable power?
	- It means a building can operate independently from the electrical grid using its own solar panels and batteries, ensuring it stays powered even during prolonged outages. All critical infrastructure like hospitals, schools, and 911 centres must have islandable power by 2035.

- Will there be prescribed burns to prevent wildfires?
	- Yes. The SPSA will work with Indigenous Nations across the province to complete prescribed burns of Saskatchewan forests to prevent future out-of-control wildfires.

- What supplies will Resilience Hubs have?
	- At minimum: potable water, cots and beds, blankets, first-aid kits, oxygen tanks, charging and power infrastructure, refrigerated medication storage, and radio and other communications equipment.
